VBR is roughly equivalent to 256 bps. 320 is pointless, as a 44.1kHz/16bit file will mathematically never use more than 256. Funny how everyone on soundcloud seems to think 320 is good. In any case, MP3 will always mean a certain amount of loss, so the only way to avoid that is to use WAV/AIFF/FLAC or RAR. In professional productions you should never employ MP3, no matter how high the bitrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you like Billy Idle's edits, get the newer ones from his own account at http://soundcloud.com/billyidle",

        "description": "Ninja Tune is an independent record label based in London, England, created in 1990 by the duo known as Coldcut: pioneers of the emerging hip-hop/electro scene in the eighties. Inspired by a visit to Japan, Matt Black \\u0026 Jonathon More primarily created Ninja Tune to release music of a more underground, experimental nature, free from the restraints placed on artists by major labels (the restraints they themselves experienced during brief stints with Arista and Big Life.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir initial releases were quickly heralded by the press and music afficionados simultaneously. The five volumes of 'DJ Food - Jazz Brakes', saw Coldcut adopt a different moniker in order to release the hypnotic, instrumental hip-hop they'd been working on. Hugely influential on the burgeoning electronic music scene, the releases are still regarded as classics to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinja Tune went on to achieve notoriety for its singularly irreverant, funky style and commitment to eclecticism. Despite the releases having a shared attitude and ethos, a constantly growing roster of very different sounding artists was key to the label's success. The darkly imagined, melodically industrial d\\u0026b of Amon Tobin was contrasted by the playful, colourful funk of Mr Scruff; DJ Food's line up encompassed Strictly Kev and PC, who went on to craft boundary breaking electronica. In 1997, journalist Will Ashon founded Big Dada as a hip hop imprint of Ninja Tune, and the sub-label went on to release classic records by Diplo, Roots Manuva, Wiley and Spank Rock, amongst others.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the musical and multi-media, cut n' paste innovation of Black and More, the studio know-how and musical expertise of artists such as Bonobo, Illum Sphere, Actress, Kid Koala and The Bug, the graphic vision of Openmind, and the sound business practices of the label managers and employees, Ninja Tune has grown into a label that prides itself on producing quality music while serving its artists in a way that no major label would. Satellite offices have opened in Los Angeles and Montreal, and the label has established an excellent reputation and strong networks across the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinja Tune now also acts as an umbrella for other creative hot houses such as Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder imprint, and the brilliant Werkdiscs, the label founded by Actress. In this way, Ninja continues to release uncompromising, forward looking music in the highest quality packaging and most professional fashion. The label's aim is not to be underground, but to win the most exposure possible for the most exciting music there is.\\r\\n",

The first classic to Ed Rush\u2019s name, this proved to be a\\nplatform for another collaboration with DJ Trace.

Still busy at work on a new Ed Rush \\u0026 Optical LP due in late 2013, Ed Rush is not merely content\\nwith helping shape the scene and remaining one of its most consistent producers.

Armed with a sensitivity and sense of occasion that few DJs possess Bill Brewster knows how to work a crowd in the best possible sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally a chef, a football pundit (co-editor of fanzine When Saturday\\r\\nComes) and record collector, Bill began DJing in in the late 80s, but he cut his teeth playing \u2018Low Life\u2019 warehouse parties in Harlem and the East Village \u2013 he moved to NYC to run DMC\u2019s US operation \u2013 and anyone hearing Bill today can see how these New York \u2018roots\u2019 shine through. For eclecticism, surprises, amazing unique music and sheer long-haul dedication to the dancefloor, Bill\u2019s your man.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis other life is as a writer. Together with long-term pal Frank Broughton, Bill is author of the definitive history of DJing, Last Night A DJ Saved My Life, and has contributed his acid Grimsby wit and encyclopaedic knowledge of music to just about every dance rag there is, not to mention The Guardian, Independent and Mail On Sunday. The Brewster-Broughton double act unveiled their latest hit in 2002 with the uniquely sardonic DJ manual How To DJ (Properly). They have recently completed an updated version of Last Night A DJ Saved My Life that will be published in June, along with a double CD from Universal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe\u2019s an industry insider, having brought Twisted records to the UK and launched his own highly successful deep house label Forensic. In his spare time he is often found in the studio, either with Fat Camp partner, Theo Noble, re-editing old disco, funk and rock records; or producing original music. They run a small edit label Disco Sucks. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs his hero Kid Creole would say, 'Annie I'm not your daddy.'\\r\\n",

Having achieved the kind of success most artists can only dream of, they\u2019ve not rested on their laurels. \\n\\nAston and Matt started working on Music together in the mid \u201890\u2019s after discovering a mutual love of Hip-Hop, Electro and Beats. They released their first two Albums \u2018We Rock Hard\u2019 and \u2018Pressure Point\u2019 on legendary Breakbeat label Freskanova.  \u2019Raw as F**K\u201d and \u2018Adventures In Freestyle\u201d were released on \u2018Against The Grain\u201d another Breaks Power House based out of Brighton,UK.  From being voted \u2018Best Band\u2019 by Muzik Magazine in \u201998, to touring with Lenny Kravitz on his American Woman Tour (he asked them himself as he was so impressed with their act), rocking a crowd of 30,000 at Glastonbury Festival \u201999, performing at MTV\u2019s Times Square Millennium Party,playing Big Day Out \u201905  \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say these Guys have had one big Adventure so far.\\n\\nThe Freestylers began their career as an Urban Electronic Music Act, and their early Tunes \u2018B-Boy Stance,\u2019\u2019 \u2018Ruffneck\u2019 and \u2018Warning\u2019 set the marker. As their Music progressed so did their Anthems with the seminal tunes \u2018Punks\u2019, \u2018Boom Blast\u2019, \u2018Fasten YourSeat-Belts\u2019,\u2019Painkiller\u201d and more recently \u2018Cracks.\u2019to list a few.In addition to their status as Underground Heroes, they have gained commercial success with their Global Hit \u2018Push Up\u2019 and have had their Music synched in many TV Commercials and Films ,including the hugely successful Comedies,Zoolander,Hey Dude Where\u2019s My Car and the more recent Sisters\\n\\nTheir ever eclectic style and renegade approach to production focuses on everything in the Bass Music Spectrum and was on show with their 5th Studio Album \u2018The Coming Storm\u2019.The current single \u201cSpread Love\u201d has been crossing boundaries with it\u2019s Bassline House/Breaks hybrid sound and soon to follow up single Hypnotic Eyez and new EP Club Tracks Vol IV have been designed for maximum dancefloor devastation.The Freestylers are here to stay and are definitely  rocking even harder.\\n\\n\\nFor all bookings enquiries \\nabel@fingerlickin.co.uk\\n\\nFor all management enquiries \\nabel@fingerlickin.co.uk\\n\\nhttp://www.freestylersmusic.co.uk",

        "description": "www.acidjazz.co.uk\\n\\nFormed back in the heady days of 1987 at the start of the \u2018acieed\u2019 explosion, Acid Jazz was the first of the groundbreaking new indie labels and paved the way for the likes of Mo Wax, Wall Of Sound and Talkin' Loud\u2026\\n\\nInitially a simple bedroom operation established by Eddie Piller and Gilles Peterson, within three months of the first 45 release (Galliano\u2019s Frederic Lies Still), the label had grown rapidly, acquired premises in London\u2019s east end and laid out a unique manifesto of alternative club sounds \u2013 jazz, street-soul, funk, latin, reggae and jazz poetry all put in an early appearance. Galliano, Chris Bangs, The Night Trains, The Last Poets, A Man Called Adam and Snowboy \\u0026 The Latin Section were amongst the first wave of label signings and they all appeared live at groundbreaking jazz themed nights at London clubs like the WAG in Soho and Camden\u2019s legendary Dingwalls.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy \u201989, Peterson had left the label to establish his own Talking Loud imprint and Piller soon moved the operation to Denmark Street, London\u2019s original Tin Pan Alley, into the former EMI music office. The next wave of signings included D Influence, Jamiroquai and The Brand New Heavies. Chart success quickly followed as the label spread its numerous tentacles around the world. The sound of the label became the name of choice for the scene that had established in its wake and by the early \u201990s, Acid Jazz was booming out of a succession of speakers from Sweden to Singapore, Hamburg to Hobart, Shibuya to Sheffield and everywhere in between. International tours followed as the label expanded through the 90\u2032s, gradually increasing their musical influences to include daisy-age hip hop, garage psyche and trip hop.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the mid-90\u2032s Acid Jazz had revived the careers of legends like Terry Callier, Brian Auger and Gregory Isaacs, established three subsidiaries (Focus, All Seeing Eye and Roots to cater for progressive indie, drum and bass and roots and culture respectively) and signed yet another wave of successful independent artists which included the likes of Corduroy, Mother Earth, The Humble Souls, Goldbug and a dozen more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 1994, the label took the plunge and opened the first \u2018non-house\u2019 based night club in London. Based on the site of the Bass Clef, a down-at-heel and eventually semi-derelict jazz club in Hoxton \u2013 perched precariously amidst the second world war bomb sites, derelict buildings and culture-free zone, the club was credited with paving the way for the whole Hoxton/Shoreditch explosion of the late nineties. Indeed, the club was rarely less than full seven nights a week hosting events from the likes of Goldie\u2019s Metalheads, Talvin Singh, Coldcut, Ab-ashanti, Athletico and the label\u2019s own Magic Bus. The Blue Note closed its doors at the end of the decade and Acid Jazz went back to what they do best: releasing records.\\n\\nJumping forward to 2014 and we find the label firmly ensconced in their office at the top of Brick Lane and after celebrating their 25th Anniversary the label is as vibrant and vital as ever. The current roster includes the critically acclaimed, prog folk fusions of Matt Berry, new indie hopefuls Dexters, the soul meet the Streets stylings of New Street Adventure and ex Bluetones lead singer Mark Morriss, whilst the highly acclaimed Rare Mod series has discovered and released previously unknown works by everyone from The Riot Squad featuring David Bowie to the Small Faces Steve Marriott.\\n\\nIn short after over a quarter of a century Acid Jazz remains one of the UK\u2019s most important independent labels.\\n",

A firm favourite in his native UK and a growing name globally, 2016 was arguably his strongest year to date, with searing club hits on Toolroom, Night Bass, Suara, Nervous, Bunny Tiger and of course \u2018The Gee\u2019: the sax-led, Club Sweat-released anthem that topped the Beatport overall chart for nearly two weeks. \\n\\nOriginally from London, Vanilla Ace has more than two decades of DJing behind him, initially growing up on a healthy dose of hip-hop, drum \\u0026 bass and house music. \\n\\nThe last few years have seen him go from strength to strength with top charting singles on Beatport and Traxsource. His 2013 \u2018Musicology\u2019 EP on OFF recordings received acclaim from bloggers, DJs and fans alike, with \u2018Bring it Back\u2019 track spending seven weeks in the Beatport Deep House top 10 with heavy support from the likes of Pete Tong, Tiesto and Seth Troxler.\\n\\nA steady stream of releases on labels such as Suara, Simma Black, Enormous, LouLou Records, Milk \\u0026 Sugar followed alongside collaborations with Destructo \\u0026 Wax Motif on Night Bass, Sharam Jey \\u0026 Illusionize on Bunny Tiger and remixing the likes of Basement Jaxx, Yolanda Be Cool, Deadmau5, Marshall Jefferson, Kylie and Moon Boots. \\n\\nHe\u2019s also found a loyal following on Spotify, where his music regularly hits close to 100k stream every month.  \\n\\nThe crowning achievement of 2016 was \u2018The Gee\u2019.

The sound is moulding, shaping and morphing at the hands of Dj Ink... \\n\\nThe year is 1990 and a young Dj Ink has solidified his love for the culture known as hip hop- as the years move on so does UK street music, there are new genres forming and Ink begins to hear what is familiar to him, but there is a new twist-It is the UK passing by the USA, with a huge dose of African and Jamaican influence, This is music to a budding Dj Ink's ears, he naturally becomes involved and it doesn\u2019t take too long before he begins to make his mark. \\n\\nFirst begins the Pirate radio circuit. Working hard at his craft and allowing the followers to get familiar with the roll, steadily bookings began to build up and soon it would be time for Ink to become associated with three names that changed the landscape of British electronic music-Basement Records, and slightly later Metalheadz and Renegade Hardware. Ink would go onto form his own imprint- Architecture Recordings, releasing anthems from himself and various crew members, bringing through new talent and the cream of the heavy hitters within drum n bass. If you're familiar with drum n bass/jungle you\u2019ll know instantly the weight these labels carry, and if you're not by just scratching the surface you\u2019ll become aware of the impact they have had. Renegade Hardware \\u0026 Metalheadz are two commitments Dj Ink has upheld to this day, through thick and thin, engraved in the wall of time.\\n\\nEssential work includes 'The 50th (Blueprint)' (1st Drum and Bass/Jungle tune on BBC Radio 1 essential DnB show ever!) and \\",

        "description": "As they gear up to celebrate 20 years of riotous marauding, the Dub Pistols are prepping their seventh as-yet-untitled album in 2017 and there\u2019ll be a documentary about the band dropping at some point in the year, too. And they\u2019ll be out on the road, as usual, of course \u2014 the hardest working band in showbiz.\\n\\nA kinda 21st century equivalent of 2-Tone acts The Specials or The Beat, the Dub Pistols are the quintessential festival band. Coming over a bit like if King Tubby and The Skatalites bumped into Terry Hall at a Goldie gig, the Dubs have reached their two decade milestone with a lot of ups and downs along the way.\u00a0\\n\\nThey\u2019ve worked with vocal legends like Rodney P, Busta Rhymes, Gregory Isaacs, Terry Hall, Lindy Layton, Akala and Horace Andy, while the band\u2019s mainstays are fiercely loyal and dedicated. An unorthodox collective of musicians who each have their own personal interests and solo projects, when they come together to form the Dub Pistols some dubwise magic happens.\\n\\nThe rhythm section of Jack (drums) and Dave (bass) are granite-solid, and guitarist Andreas (or sometimes the rock \\u0026 roll stand-in, Johnny Rockstar) provides all sorts of licks and skanking chords to nice up the dance. The brass section is on fire, and rapper Seanie Tee brings the mic skills to complement main man Barry Ashworth perfectly. They\u2019re a proper gang of outlaws, rebels with a cause, renegade outsiders who know how to bring the good times. If you haven\u2019t seen the Pistols yet\\nBarry might be the heart, face and mouth of the Dubs, but they are still very much a band \u2014 as tight as fuck, and yet able to cut loose to rock venues to the core. Tracks like epic drum \\u0026 bass cut \u2018Gunshot\u2019, ska ditty \u2019Problem Is\u2019, early beat-freak single \u2018Cyclone\u2019 and singalong anthem \u2018Mucky Weekend\u2019 have become firm fan favourites, and onstage see the band getting deep, down and dirty. With a nod to their ska influence, and the fact that Terry Hall was an honorary Dub Pistol for a few years, they still do a lively version of \u2018Gangsters\u2019 - The Specials\u2019 first ever single. But otherwise it\u2019s all their own work \u2014 the back catalogue is rich in flavas.\\n\\n\u201cThe next album is actually a bit more chilled-out than the last two,\u201d says Barry. \u201cIt\u2019s still a classic Dub Pistols album, but \u2018Return Of The Pistoleros\u2019 and \u2018Worshipping The Dollar\u2019 were more club-orientated \u2014 leaning more towards peak-time bangers. This album is a bit more relaxed, with a\u00a0smoked-out reggae vibe \u2014 although there are still a couple of\u00a0bangers on there.\u201d\\n\\nThe guests on the next album read like a who\u2019s who of conscious styles. Dancehall dons Beenie Man and Cutty Ranks, reggae singer Earl16, young hip-hop act Too Many T's, seminal MCs Navigator and the Ragga Twins, and long-time collaborator Lindy Layton (and dope rapper Genesis Elijah??) all bring their unique talents. Some of these will be appearing with the Dubs live over the coming year as the band present a history lesson in all the different bases they\u2019ve covered over the past two decades. With added bass!\\n\\nBand members may have come and gone, but the progression of the core of the band is constant. \u201cIt\u2019s never like everyone leaves at once,\u201d says Barry. \u201cPeople\u2019s priorities change: they get married or have kids and the lifestyle isn't for them anymore, so they leave \u2014 but luckily not all at the same time. So someone new comes in, and suddenly it feels like a new band.\u201d",

        "description": "There were plenty of reasons for Londoner James Math\u00e9 to simply keep course after the release of his well received debut album, Chemical Campfires in 2008 on Fence Records: a flourishing reputation as one of Britain's most exciting acoustic troubadours, a prominent spot in Johnny Flynn and Jose Gonzales' backing bands, the roar of applause from the audience at a sold-out show at New York's Bowery Ballroom still ringing in his ears. But Math\u00e9 had other ideas. \u201cI loved the acoustic scene, but knew it was not all I was about,\u201d he remembers. \u201cSo I dug out all my old Casiotone keyboards, drum machines and analogue synths and just started writing.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBloodlines, then, is a compelling reinvention and sees Math\u00e9\u2019s emotive missives from young adulthood rewired into elegiac electronic anthems, dusted with huge spectral gasps of reverb and soul-wrenching organ melodies. Unusually for such an electronic album, it was recorded on vintage analogue gear and straight to tape.  \u201cI really fancied getting back to basics,\u201d says Math\u00e9 \u201cI was tired of trying to iron out all the mistakes in modern production. I wanted to record live to tape, keeping all the mistakes in, warts and all.\u201d   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the sultry ache of opener Bloodline \u2013 a nod to Massive Attack's Unfinished Sympathy \u201cabout not picking up the bad habits of the generation before you\u201d, says Math\u00e9 \u2013 to the Pharrell Williams-inspired urban crunch of \u2018Turbine\u2019, all the way to \u2018The Load\u2019, written when Math\u00e9 was indulging in his love of Jurassic 5 era 90s hip hop, Bloodlines is a brilliantly varied listen that pulls and paws at your heartstrings.    If there's a gloriously loose, tenebrous feel to songs like the blue-eyed electro-soul \u2018Pagliacco\u2019, it might have something to do with the Londoner's organic approach to song writing. \u201cI just sit down with my dictaphone and make sense of what comes out afterwards. The best stuff usually comes when I\u2019m hungover or not really thinking. The minute I try to be clever with words, it just sounds shit,\u201d Math\u00e9 laughs.  Instead, the album's lyrics burn with a simple, poignant immediacy and Math\u00e9 sings them with touching, soulful grace. \\r\\n\\r\\nRecently signed to iconic London label Memphis Industries (Field Music, POLI\u00c7A, The Go! Team, Dutch Uncles), Math\u00e9 is influenced by everything from soul men Stevie Wonder, D'Angelo and Levon Helm to Dirty Projectors and Sufjan Stevens but points to one inspiration in particular for the overall mood of Bloodlines \u2013 Vincent Gallo\u2019s cult '90s film Buffalo 66, a twisted romance about a tap dancer who falls for her convict kidnapper \u2013 \u201cthe end scene which features Yes's Heart of the Sunrise and the scene with Cristina Ricci dancing to King Crimson\u2019s Moonshine at a bowling hall especially,\u201d he notes. \\r\\n\\r\\nTender yet triumphant, Bloodlines marks Math\u00e9 as one of Britain's most versatile and adventurous artists.\\r\\n",

We got high. Much love to the Hemps\u201d \u2013 Paolo Nutini\\n\\n\u201cThe Hempolics are the best band in the UK \u2013 but nobody knows it yet...\u201d - Maxi Jazz (Faithless)\\n\\n\u201cReal vintage lo fi reggae inspired soul music for the 21st century city scape people\u201d \u2013 DJ Vadim\\n\\n\u201cGreat summer vibes.

And amazing live too!\u201d - Eliza Doolittle\\n\\n\u201cThe best thing I\u2019ve heard in ages\u201d La Roux\\n\\nThe Hempolics are out to put those organic rootsy vibes back into music; with their fat radio-friendly hooks, bumping soundsystem bass and a wanderlusty, ineffably real sound all of their own...\\n\\nOver years of recording top international talent The Hempolics enigmatic leader, Grippa Laybourne, has been carefully honing his own masterpiece and selecting a gang armed and dangerous enough to execute it. The Hempolics caused an instant stir with their single Serious which hit number one in the UK reggae charts and was playlisted on Massive Attack\u2019s BBC takeover.\\n\\nNew debut album \u2018Kiss, Cuddle \\u0026 Torture Vol. 1\u2019 has seen the band erupt with three singles playlisted by BBC6 Music and support from Steve Lamacq, Toddla T, Rodigan \\u0026 Don Letts to name a few. Liz Kershaw selected the album on her \u2018all killer, no filler\u2019 best albums of the past 30 years and invited the band to play her BBC anniversary show after hearing them smash a live session for Lauren Laverne on BBC6. It\u2019s not just on radio that the band have been breaking with album track \u2018Samurai\u2019 synced to the worldwide trailer for Coen Brothers and George Clooney film \u2018Hail, Caesar!\u2019\\n\\nSounding like the i-pod of the attention-deficit generation and swelled by guest appearances from various international talents The Hempolics have a storm brewing that promises to tear up the UK music scene. Recording underground style throughout the bedrooms and home studios of the band The Hempolics have created an infectious mash-up of Reggae, Electro, Hip-Hop, Soul, Rock and Pop. Although the weather out might be dull London-side it\u2019s strictly sunshine vibes, resplendent with huge hooks and festival friendly choruses. These are tunes that people will be bopping to across festivals, clubs and car journeys for years to come.\\n\\nThe Hempolics pedigree recordings are combined with tight as a tick live performances \u2013 honed at their own underground club night in London \u2013 and they are amongst the up and coming acts to watch. They are the brainchild of veteran sound engineer and record producer Grippa Laybourne. Core vocalists, the empyreal Nubiya and devilishly dashing Dandelion, combine together impeccably, with Dan\u2019s brother Harry sometimes stepping in with his own smooth tones. The rest of the band comprises of deft bassist Lorenzo, Leon King who ranks up there with the finest Reggae/Dub guitarists around and the exceptional Craig Boorman on drums.\\n\\nTake your eye off The Hempolics at your peril.

It's our own fault (we've encouraged it), and with J Saul Kane steering the ship, it was perhaps inevitable that this would be the case. \\r\\n\\r\\nRising from the ashes of Vinyl Solution in 1995, the plucked phoenix that is DC Recordings was originally formed as an outlet for Kane's wayward audio adventures. Almost immediately, like-minded artists began to gravitate towards his obviously creaky ship and, over sixty releases later, the ship is (somewhat remarkably) still afloat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a catalogue that boasts an array of ground breaking contemporary artists as well as exclusive issues of lost sound tracks and Holy Grail hip hop classics, DC Recordings is a label that has survived by refusing to compromise its singular and willfully idiosyncratic vision.

        "description": "One look at Rodney P\u2019s discography illustrates a who\u00b4s who of the UK music scene. He has collaborated with fellow UK Hip Hop giants Skinnyman, Blak Twang and The Nextmen; featured on various Soul and R\\u0026B productions with artists such as Omar, Terri Walker and The Brand New Heavies; and appeared on dance and electro tracks with MJ Cole, Roni Size, The Stanton Warriors, Timo Maas and recently, French producer/DJ Flore. More unusual affiliations with artists like Bjork and Nitin Sawhney demonstrate his role as a genre defying emcee as well as reflecting his own diverse musical taste.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstantly in demand as a live performer, he has performed across the globe to fans in Europe, China, Japan, Australia, America and numerous African nations. For the last few years Rodney has extensively toured with The Dub Pistols, performing to huge audiences around the world as well as maintaining his partnership with DJ Skitz. During the summer of 2010 Rodney P and Skitz, along with a handful of other acts joined forces with Chai Wallahs and performed at festivals across the UK including Bestival, The Secret Garden Party and Glastonbury.\\r\\n\\r\\n2012 began a new chapter with the signing of a multiple album deal on Tru Thoughts, which will see the release of eagerly awaited new material. The first of that new material is the \u201cSleepin\u2019 Giantz\u201d album released in 2012. Sleepin\u2019 Giantz is the coming together of three great minds \u2013 Rodney P, Zed Bias \\u0026 Fallacy. Forging links between Hip Hop, Grime and Dubstep their debut album was released on Tru Thoughts in 2012. Zed Bias is the main musical alter ego of the Manchester based producer Dave Jones, one of the founders of Break Beat Garage. Rodney P has been widely regarded as the Godfather of British Hip Hop. Fallacy is the missing link between grime and UK Hip Hop. Together they are Sleepin\u2019 Giantz.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodney has also just begun work on a brand new series for the YouTube sensation SBTV called \u2018Skooled By\u2019. The aim of the show is to pay some respect to the artists that helped pave the way and form the foundation of the Urban UK music scene.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs an artist and performer Rodney P never stops trying to please his ever growing fan base and with plans to release some previously unreleased London Posse material in 2013, as well as working on his eagerly anticipated new solo album fans of the \u2018RiddimKilla\u2019 should be excited by what the Future holds in store.\\r\\n",

        "description": "In four years Urban Nerds has risen in the ranks of underground clubbing to become one of London\u2019s biggest bass brands.\\n\\nThe first Nerds rave hit East London in 2007 to provide a new home to underground genres spanning dubstep, grime, electro, hip-hop, drum \\u0026 bass, reggae and beyond. Nerds was one of the \ufb01rst nights in the big smoke to pioneer a multi-genre concept and the amalgamation of bass culture that\u2019s since been adopted across the country and in\ufb01ltrated the full spectrum of electronic music. As underground British beats \\u0026amp; blips become increasingly genre-crossing and too often branded with the \u2018bass\u2019 bracket, Urban Nerds maintains its position as one of the best events in the country to embrace this new dance hybrid.\\n\\nFour years down the line and the Urban Nerds count themselves part of the lucky few to have hosted room 3 at Fabric and room 2 at Matter, with a landmark Fabriclive room 2 debut in July 2011. They\u2019ve collaborated on events with music moguls such as Mixmag, Time Out and the much respected DMC World DJ Championships. In 2011 Nerds returned to Europe\u2019s biggest ski and snowboard festival, Snowbombing, as an official club partner for the third year running.\\n\\nIn LDN Urban Nerds were amongst the \ufb01rst on the bass scene to take the sounds of the underground out of the club, pushing boundaries with a string of sell-out warehouse events that regularly see 1500 clubbers dub-step their way through the night in unique, mind-blowing locations. In warehouses from Shoreditch to Southwark, in dark East End basements, in iconic London venues and increasingly cross-country in Europe, Urban Nerds raves have become known for a great atmosphere, a strong and loyal crowd and an unashamed love for a plethora of bass-led party sounds. \\n\\nThere\u2019s really no one else who\u2019s as nerdy about British underground urban music as this lot.\\n\\nFor more hit up http://www.urban-nerds.com \\n\\n\\n",

        "description": "Alex Tepper is the power behind the throne. You may scratch your head upon hearing his name, but be damn sure you\u2019ve heard some of the hundreds of releases that have been touched by his hands in almost 20 years in the business. Working behind enemy lines under a variety of pseudonyms or as collaborator to some of the biggest names in house music, his releases have had everyone from Pete Tong to Kevin Saunderson heaping plaudits on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor someone who\u2019s only just skirting 30 it\u2019s pretty remarkable that he has such pedigree, but then Alex was something of a teenage prodigy. While most kids were happy to watch Grange Hil, skive off school and felt pen knobs on toilet walls, Alex was a super-keen schoolboy in a Birmingham studio providing hot beverages for everyone from ace reggae band Steel Pulse to hard rockers like Black Sabbath. But it was in Rich Bitch studios in Birmingham where he first discovered house music through two DJs Phil Dockerty and Adam Presdee. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe cut his chops helping to programme releases for the Urban Hero label, feeding a growing obsession with New York mastermixers like Todd Terry and Masters at Work. \u201cI remember going to the Sound Factory Bar in New York for Louie Vega's Underground Network night and it happened to be Barbara Tucker\u2019s birthday that night. D-Train were playing live (with Barbara ad-libbing), Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian was playing a party set of disco and hip hop in the basement and, of course, Louie in the main room. It was one of those magical New York nights.\u201d Although Alex\u2019s heart lay in New York, it was his unique take on that sound that produced hits like X-Presidents\u2019 Diamond Rings, which somehow became a UK garage hit (\u201cI\u2019m still scratching my head over that one,\u201d chuckles Alex).\\r\\n\\r\\nHis partnership with Dockerty as Futureshock resulted in an array of stellar remixes \u2013 among them New Order, Chemical Brothers and St. Etienne \u2013 a label venture with Junior Boys Own and leading DJs falling over themselves to praise the pair. \u201cInnovative dance music for a new era,\u201d praised Pete Tong, while a certain Mr. Tenaglia simply said, \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is so up my alley.\u201d Touring with Underworld was not to be sniffed at either. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince those crazy, heady days as part of the Futureshock juggernaut, Alex has been taking something of a backseat, though his workload has not eased up. Over the past few years, secreted away in his secret beat laboratory, The Dog House, in the heart of balmy Dalston, Alex has been providing the know-how for a variety of premier league DJs, collaborating regularly with Steve Lawler, Nic Fanciulli, Nicole Moudaber and a host of others, who\u2019ve come to him for a sprinkling of Tepper magic with releases on Get Physical, Cocoon, R\\u0026S, Ovum and many others. Power behind the throne, see. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut that\u2019s only one part of Alex\u2019s work. The other is as a solo artist and over the years, he\u2019s had a wildly diverse range of releases under a bewildering array of monikers (Alex In Wonderland, Rhythm\u2019N\u2019Vibe, Latino Circus, X-Presidents, Town Crier). Lately, under his own name he\u2019s had tracks out on Drumcode, Souvenir, Rekids and more recently Nic Fanciulli\u2019s label Saved. \u201cIn many respects, I\u2019ve got the best of both worlds. I get to collaborate with loads of really good DJs and those shared ideas inevitably flow back into the work I do on my own. It re-energises my solo stuff.\u201d \\r\\n\\r\\nHe\u2019s not kidding. As his solo career gathers pace, the kings at the top of the game need to watch their seats. He\u2019s gunning for their crowns. \\r\\n",

Through her time at the Starlight Arts Academy and her experiences in the social system, Emshey honed her rap skills in the streets and nursed a secret weapon in a fantastic singing voice.

He picked up his musical style whilst touring with the Prod in mid 90\u2019s\u00ad it is a mix of tuff Electrobreaks, old skool samples, Hip Hop, rock and electro.

He has a certain way with words that keep the listener  interested in what he has to say. Joe Black started out emceeing to speed garage in 1998. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe attended the music workshop at  George Orwell School which was ran by Heartless Cru\u2019s DJ Fonti. He started rapping to Hip Hop in  2000 whilst doing a prison sentence. However, he didn\u2019t start taking it seriously until his good friend  Felony introduced his to his cousins, Real Gees. It was at the Real Gees studio where people started to take notice of him. He recorded eight tracks  at his first recording session.  Together with Real Gees, he went on to produce 2004\u2019s Pedal Bike  Diaries. He went on to appear on the Hottest Mixtape of 2006, Mashtowns S.P.O.R.T.S. VOL 1. That further solidified his name as a promising lyricist. After a few collaborations with some local artists he received another prison sentence. He was released in September 2007 and  immediately got to work with his cousin Red. He recorded his second Mixtape, Business As Usual. He released the Business As Usual  just before Christmas 2007. It is currently in stores across London. Joe Black released Certified on the 1st of September 2008 in conjunction with Ruthless Recordz. That CD is available at Ruthless  Recordz and all other good record shops. \\r\\n\\r\\nJoe Black went on to release another Mixtape King of the Underground in February 2010 and has since performed with some of the  biggest names in the music scene right now (Rick Ross, Giggs, K Koke, Benny Banks, Hunt, Squeeks and Propane). He recently releaed the very well received mixtape project 'Realionaire.'\\r\\n\\r\\nBe on the look out for Joe Black and the rest of his CMG family in 2012",

Together with sparring partner Rakai, Tom initiated International Observer, a sound system that has quietly infiltrated various Auckland events over the past five years, creating a legendary reputation for marathon five-hour sets of exquisitely-crafted slo-mo dubscapes.\\n\\nEarly in 2002, having amassed enough material for a boxed set, Tom set about pruning the oevre down to an ideal International Observer primer, called 'Seen'. While he attempted to keep the wraps on this absurdly tasty release, it was somewhat inevitable that previews were sneaked out of seclusion, resulting in extensive radio play worldwide and eager members of the press corps frothing at the mouth for IO morsels. It's been called the lushest, deepest, most caringly crafted dub-a-tronic exploration ever released, a cunning experiment in melodic instrumental dub that, without losing its edge, makes for the most gorgeously seductive meditative listening experience. It was released in NZ by Beautiful Music, and the rest of the world by Different Drummer.\\n\\nThis release was followed in 2005 by \\",

From a young age Skilf was no stranger to the stage: a child actor performing at theatres and even starring in a full feature TV film. His passion for music was sparked a few years later as he started getting into hip hop and dance music, studying other rappers' wordplay and art of rhyming. \\r\\n\\r\\nHe began writing, recording and performing - jumping on the mic over Garage/Drum 'n' Bass sets at house parties, open mic nights and pirate radio. His energetic delivery and ability to rhyme over different tempos and sounds grabbed peoples attention and gradually Skilf started getting booked for club nights, uni shows and festivals. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince independently releasing his debut album \u00e2\u0080\u0098Original Visions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in 2008, Skilf has received airplay on stations such as 1Xtra, BBC Introducing, BBC Asian Network and Kiss FM. He has shared stages with the likes of Pendulum, Ghostface Killah (Wu Tang Clan), Tim Westwood, Chipmunk, Taio Cruz, Skream, Benga and Sam \\u0026 The Womp to name a few.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis collaborative work spans from Dance music legend Ashley Beedle to Dubstep star Youngman, producers Agent X and Hip Hop talents such as Genesis Ellijah, Serocee, Ceezlin, Dizraeli and Supar Nova.\u00c2\u00a0Earlier this year Skilf teamed up with Irish production duo John Gibbons \\u0026amp; Scimon Tist and made \u00e2\u0080\u0098Colder\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which received extensive radio play and reached the top 40 in the official Republic of Ireland charts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSkilf's\u00c2\u00a0forthcoming album \u00e2\u0080\u0098Second Thought\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is more upbeat and dance based than previous releases with bass driven Electro/House beats, soulful hooks and bouncy, energetic flows.

        "description": "cer\\r\\n\\r\\n'it's always been about forward music...'\\r\\n\\r\\nDJ Wonder AKA E2's Wayne Gardner was beating a path towards the future of garage before any of the roads where sign-posted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom DJing on Rinse at 2am with Dizzee when it was broadcasting out of a hut on a building site to being a founder member of Roll Deep, Wonder has been there at key points during this homegrown music's development.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an 18 year-old he was enrolled in a business course at college. When one of his lessons was cancelled a DJ friend suggest they go and have a mix instead. From that first play on the decks Wonder was hooked. He changed his focus from wanting to do 'something in computers' to being swept up in the whirlwind energy of the last days of garage and the dawn of grime.\\r\\n\\r\\nHooked he enrolled in a '12 week community college introduction to music production course' round the corner in E1. Another young man from the area enrolled on the same course at the same time by coincidence. Called Danny Weed, he was the younger brother of the singer Dom P from the one of UK garage's biggest crews Pay As You Go.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaking friends Wonder immediately found himself in one of the most exciting musical places in the world in the early noughties \u2013 as a the futuristic new British computer sound started to develop Wonder quickly rose as a DJ within the movement. He went out to Ayia Napa in 2002 playing raves like Sun City. Returning to London his status had sky-rocketed and he was given the 7pm primetime slot on Rinse. In 2011 Rinse is properly established with plenty of column inches eulogising it, a legal license and an extraordinary roll call of stars it has given a first chance and a platform too (Devlin, Skream, Dizzee, Plastician, Skepta, Katy B).\\r\\n\\r\\n'It was an exciting time. We would be doing three radio shows a day and bookings at night. Travelling, going to shows. Other artists were coming through. N.A.S.T.Y. Crew, Ruff Squad.'\\r\\n\\r\\nCome 2003 however, Wonder had started to explore a new darker sound that was incubating at a little club on Curtain Road, Old Street an a night called FWD\\u003e. DJing alongside a new group of producers from far south of the Thames, Wonder's sound was changing from the skeletal minimalism of grime into a more sub-focussed 'dark garage' sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004 former Pay As U Go member and Rinse FM founder Geeneus released Wonder's first big production hit. It was called 'What' and sold more then 4000 vinyl on Geeneus's Dumpvalve Records. 'Back then dub step wasn't established yet, so it fitted in the grime scene. When dub step was established I started mixing up my set with dub step and grime. Now these scenes seem separate and defined. Back in the day you had to create you're own scene. There wasn't a lot of labels involved. Investing your own money, pressing up your own vinyl, distributing your own vinyl. When I first started producing in 2002 having a vinyl release was quite a big thing.'\\r\\n\\r\\nWith it's shuffling syncopated hi hats, grimey Eastern-scale lead synth and rolling sub-bass 'What' was the 'wot do u call it' track linking grime and dubstep in 2004. Grime's Mercury prize winning young break out star Dylan Mills AKA Dizzee Rascal snapped up the instrumental that year for his second album 'Showtime' \u2013 renaming it 'Respect Me'.\\r\\n\\r\\nWonder became tour DJ for Dizzee, travelling Europe and America bringing British bass music to new audiences. The internet was starting to bring his music to fans far from london. 'I remember going over to Amsterdam and these two boys knew all the unreleased dub plates I had even without them being released'. Dizzee's Showtime tour visited 25 US states. At the end of it Wonder decided to step up and start working on his first artist album\\r\\n\\r\\n2008's Welcome to Wonderland blended his characteristically dark and eerie soundscapes with a host of top talent from grime, UK hip hop and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod's Gift contributed a fiery dancehall inflected track. N.A.S.T.Y crew's leading light Kano dropped a typically quick-witted, sharp-tongued commentary on relationships. Walthamstow's ex-boxer MC Bruza rides 'Shout' with his punchy flow. Meanwhile Sway was white hot from off the back of his 'The Signature LP' and sounding fantastic over a grimier texture. 1 year before his pop breakthrough year in 2009 Mr Hudson sings a love song over a techno-garage roller. South African-born Mpho Skeef blessed 'More' with soul as British as rain on concrete.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn hindsight Wonder's 2006 mix of grime vocalists, pop singers and dubstep flavours looks like a glimpse of what the mainstream would look like in 2012. Wonder's proud to have been part of a homegrown movement that has taken its rightful place at the centre of the nations listening habits. 'I was with Slimzee the other day and he played me a radio show from 2004/2005 of them DJing on Radio 1 on the Dreem Team show. That was the only garage/grime being played on Radio 1 back then. Compared to now you're getting grime and dubstep played on the A list.'\\r\\n\\r\\nBut like the station he manned at the very beginning Wonder compulsively moving forward and never recycling. In 2011 he is taking time off DJing getting back in the lab, concocting the sequel to Welcome to Wonderland. Thanks to the effort of pioneering DJs on Radio 1 and 1Xtra like Mistajam and Annie Mac there has never been a bigger audience for the 'future garage' he helped create. A slew of amazing and surprising collaborators lined up for Wonderland 2, 2012 might just be a wonderful year.",

        "description": "Double O formally 007 was brought up on lots of different forms of black music growing up as a child. Reggae, Soul, Funk, Rare Groove , Calypso. Then later on Electro, hip Hop, Detroit Techno Hardcore and Jungle etc. He started making music in the late 80ies inspired by his older Brother who had his own  Reggae sound system. Also with  the help of his Mother and Father who helped buy him his first keyboard,TB 303 and later on in the years sampler(God bless you Mum n Dad).He would often go to clubs in Sheffield where a Dj called Winston Hazel would play peoples demos, producers like Nightmares on wax and Rob gordon from early Warp records etc were just a few of the artists who would submit their demos to get played by Winston. This inspired him to want to take his music and Djing further , Double O started Djing professionally in the early 90ies at the Doncaster warehouse and various clubs up North. At the Warehouse he had his first release with Dj Mzone a 4 track ep which he remembers they distributed themselves traveling to lots of different records shops up North for e.g.  Eastern Block records in Manchester . While  Djing in the warehouse a few years later he met Dj Oldskool legend Stu Allan who he would sometimes mc for when he played his set at the Warehouse . Stu who liked Double O,s Mcing  style encouraged him to do some singing on some tracks for a commercial Label called Red Raw. The track ended up getting to 56 in the commercial charts but Unfortunately this direction was not the direction Double O wanted to take his music but he did value the experience. Double O also met Dj SS where he made and put out one of his biggest and most well known productions called the Undercover Agent EP on Formation Records and it was being played by a lot of the scenes big DJs at the time Djs like Grooverider , Ratty and Randall would regularly play tracks from the ep. Around the same time  he also made a tune at L doubles Studio with the same sample(Michael prophet Your love vocal)  which was on one of the tunes from the undercover ep(your love). Due to some confusion and inexperience the tune ended coming out on Reinforced Records called low Key Movements \\",

Indigenous Folk, Brazilian \\u0026 Latino to South American sounds. African meets Jamaica, Eastern, Klezmer \\u0026 Celtic traditions.

        "description": "\\nAn individual who is undoubtedly synonymous with the birth, growth and rise of UK Dance music particularly Drum N Bass is DJ Grooverider and two words synonymous to him are Pioneer and Icon. Having been integrally involved within the UK underground scene for well over 15 years he has participated in and supervised its evolution to it now being an highly eclectic club culture regarded and revered globally for being one of the most dynamic and developed.\\n\\nDespite being for the most part associated with Drum N bass and regarded by both avid listeners and his fellow artist and peers as being the Godfather of this genre, he himself is quick to publicise his own musical journey charting his other creative influences and exploits prior to the birth of Drum and Bass. I\u2019ve listened to black music all my life. Reggae, Hip Hop, R\\u0026B, Funk, Disco the whole thing. I started cruising to house then Hardcore. Now its drum n bass but house is what I know inside out.\\n\\nThat\u2019s what I grew up with, my first love. I know everything about it. Drum n bass is something we formulated out of house. Its this cultured journey which qualifies him for almost unrivalled praise and recognition as clearly his efforts and his contributions have been critical in helping to establish and nurture UK Urban music as we know it today, which is flourishing as one of the most lucrative mainstream genres. As a DJ his credentials are phenomenal and testament to this is the fact that despite the underground club scene having unbelievably calmed since the memorable and tumultuous years of the 80 and 90s rave era, Grooverider is of a select few DJs who continues to play out at numerous events many of which are worldwide.\\n\\nThis acclaim and notoriety is a far cry from the so called early days and his time on a sound systems and pirate radio station Ill always be a DJ first. I used to DJ on a sound system years ago then I got on to a radio station It was called Phase 1 I was playing acid house every Sunday morning, like, 8 \u2019til 10 in the morning sometimes we would start 3 am and go on \u2019til the next day The guy who owned the station opened a club after-hours and booked me and Fabio, cause we were both on the station This association with Fabio also considered by many as a forefather to the scene, proved not to be a flash in the pan and the two of them remain close friends, sidekicks and business partners and presently cohost the weekly radio 1 Drum n Bass show. Amongst Grooverider\u2019s lasting legacy will be not that he simply helped establish the genre but also he helped it grow and expand it by exporting this energetic and progressive music to those who traditionally would not have listened to it.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about me and Fabio, its a whole platform for drum n bass. It\u2019s about what\u2019s happening in drum n bass, taking it on the road and showing people who dont necessarily go to drum n bass parties that this is what we do.\u201d This aim is clearly something that motivates him and it is clear that his long journey to where he is today had many challenges and struggles but with tenacity and resilience he started also to gain the respect of larger legitimate mainstream radio stations who could no longer ignore the genre or Grooverider, eventually he was given a set on Kiss Fm. We were on Kiss before and when Radio 1 called us in we ran at it.\\n\\nIn closing Grooverider has had a profound influence on UK music in general and in several different capacities as he has successfully assumed the both mantles of being a pioneering DJ and Producer. He is also the recipient of countless underground and global dance awards but perhaps his most reputed achievement was the MOBO best DJ award he won in 2002. As long as he continues to play at massive events, produce great tunes and pursue his Radio 1 shows it is likely that he will receive many more awards yet and each one will be deserve\\n",

Dayne figured out quite early what he wanted to do.\\nWith no experience and only 14 years old, he managed to convince a Zimbabwean Club owner to let him play for free(as it was the only way to get close to Djing equipment) on Wednesday nights playing a blend of African and Western Dance music.(which eventually lead to playing Friday nights and being paid in drinks.)\\nThe club eventually shut down and his DJing hobby was forced to take a break. \\nIn 2005 he left for the UK and bought a set of turntables with his first pay cheque. From there started playing local parties and got residencies on some of London\u2019s Pirate Radio stations. Having always had a varied taste in music, Dayne soon developed into a multi genre DJ and Producer, taking influence from UK genres like Garage and Funky House, which eventually lead him into House and Techno.\\nHe went on to play at venues such as Egg Club, XOYO, Ministry Of Sound, Fire Club,Tobacco Docks,o2 Academy and KOKO.  \\nPlaying alongside world renowned DJ's such as Kenny Larkin, Derrick May,Marco Bailey,Moritz Van Oswald,Mind Against,David Morales,Todd Terry +more. \\nWhile not playing London\u2019s clubs, Dayne is in the studio perfecting his sound that\u2019s already getting the attention of major labels such as Sony and Australia\u2019s Vicious Black, who recently released his Top 3 club chart remix of Maze \\u0026 Masters \u2018Joan Rivers\u2019. The track was then featured on the Toolroom Records  \u201cThis Is Toolroom 2016\u201d compilation which made it to Number 1 on the Beatport Top 100 Tech House Releases Chart.\\nKeep an eye on Dayne in 2017, he is one to watch.\\nManagement - Mark Bowden: info@dotdotdot.club \\nBookings / Promos - dayneharpermusic@gmail.com\\n \\n\\nTwitter: @DayneHarperUK \\nFacebook: DayneHarperUK\\nSoundcloud: www.soundcloud.com/dayneharper\\nInstagram: Dayneharper",

Mind Sweep brings you deep baselines buried beneath atmospheric and hypnotic soundscapes with a fusion of digital and analogue production techniques, giving his music a powerful lucidity that resonates with hyper-charged dancefloors.\\n\\nMatt's unrelenting passion and his fearsome energy have found an affinity within this new sound that is at the cutting edge of psychedelic music. This new musical direction opens up the doorway for him to beautifully express the raw energy that is packed into his personality, bringing to life the intense energies that permeate his existence.\\n\\nHaving released on labels such as Magic Phangan, 24/7, Mutagen, Aphid Records, to just a few and worked with such artists as Mechanimal, Endeavour, Intelligence, Aphidmoon, Sinerider and recently remixed Materia and  much more. Now working with such artists as Disorder, Plasmotek, Attik, Shockwave, Rubix Qube and more, as well as some solo material, you can expect to see the new and exciting style Contineum has forged over the last 2 years.

This has led to the release of four successful albums and a Mercury Prize nomination, among many high profile plaudits.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter gaining notoriety on the London underground scene Ty signed to Big Dada records in 2001, the same year his mighty debut album \u2018Awkward\u2019 was released. The union between the artist and label saw a further two albums \u2013 2003\u2019s Mercury-nominated \u2018Upwards\u2019 and \u2018Closer\u2019 (2006) \u2013 released over five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince his fourth solo album, \u2018Special Kind of Fool\u2019, was released in 2010 via BBE records, Ty has featured and collaborated with many artists stretching from America to France. Closer to home, Ty features on a tribute to the late Amy Winehouse, released in early 2012, and most recently recorded a track with former Radio 1 DJ and producer Kissy Sell Out.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lifelong love of hip hop has seen the honest speaking South Londoner gain skills in sound engineering and producing, the latter leading to work with Scratch Perverts, Talib Kweli, Blak Twang and Arrested Development. \\r\\n\\r\\nTy is also known for his work as a spoken word artist. Earlier this year he was asked to perform and host workshops for the British Council, which culminated in the conclusion of a 35 year halt on international performers in the Sudanese town of Port Sudan. As well as this, his spoken word efforts have seen Ty put in performances at The Big Chill Festival and The Royal Albert Hall. Alongside his work with the British Council Ty is also a member of The HipHop Shakespeare Company, running workshops with young people, showing the influences and works of Shakespeare in today\u2019s music scene.",

Not only has Prince Rapid completed UK tours at massive venues including o2 Arena and Hammersmith Apollo with Tinchy Stryder, Chipmunk and Devlin, he has also performed at the Round House, the BBC1 Weekender, and at a number of shows across Europe.\\n\\nAs Prince was growing up in the heart of East London, he didn't want to be a super hero capturing villains, or an athlete capturing medals; he dreamt of being the kind of musician that would capture hearts, minds and most importantly, the attention of the world. Music isn't just about melodies and lyrics for Prince, it represents a movement; a movement about vast knowledge and life values that can be shared and celebrated throughout the planet in all civilisations and societies; Prince is a big believer and supporter of inclusion.\\n\\nPrince Rapid\u2019s main inspirations come from great artists such as African legend Fela Kuti, Michael Jackson, Pay As You Go crew and Brandy. His style of music is energetic and influenced by grime, afro beats, house and garage, Hip Hop, and RnB. With the advancement of technology, the evolution of music, and innovation, Prince has been able to produce cutting edge styles that don\u2019t quite fit into traditional genres. His singing and melodic arrangements are harmonious and soulful giving off a soothing soft vibe matched with raw, rough and edgy beats and lyrics that immediately catch the listeners attention. \\n",

        "description": "Terence Paul Ryan, AKA Terry Hooligan is a respected DJ, Label owner, Remixer, beat maker, avid record \\u0026 sneaker collector, Classic Hip Hop enthusiast and last but not least Independent underground superstar!\\r\\n His entry into the music business was as one half of the now legendary ATOMIC HOOLIGAN. But this wasn\u2019t the beginning for him. Terry had been forging a name for himself in the Hip Hop DJ battle / Radio scene years before.  It was when he met Mat Welch through a mutual friend 1998 that Terry\u2019s musical direction changed. He was exposed to the sound of Nu Skool Breaks when Atomic Hooligan was born and started recording demo\u2019s.  Then in 2000, Vini at Botchit \\u0026 Scarper records heard these demos\u2019s and sighed Atomic Hooligan to a 2 album deal.  The rest as they say is History. Terry then toured the world for the next decade under the Hooligan banner (He is the first International DJ to ever go to Russia and play breaks as quoted by Lady Waks in DJ Mag) . In this time, Terry \\u0026 Mat recorded \\u0026 released 2 albums and remixed everyone from Underworld to James Brown.  The guys also started a live band to accommodate the sound they had pushed with their albums. This took the Hooligans to a new height, playing at the biggest festivals and clubs worldwide (Their \u201cYou Are Here\u201d album going to no.5 in the Japanese national Album Charts off the back of an extensive nationwide live tour). While all this was going on the Hooligans managed win multiple times at the International Breakbeat awards (Twice for best live act \\u0026 for Best Album) and grace the covers of both IDJ \\u0026 DJ Mag. At the end of 2010, Atomic Hooligan released 2 singles on respected label Functional, gaining their first beatport.com No.1 and the labels first entry into the Cool Cuts chart. Proving that Atomic Hooligan are still as relevant now as they were a decade ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerry has always had a clear view of the music he wanted to hear and play. Far from being a follower, he decided that the best way to express this view on a wider scale was to start his own label. So in 2004 with Jay Cunning, Terry founded Menu Music. At the height of Hooligan fever, Terry stepped up \\u0026 forged his own lane. This provided a great opportunity for Terry to nurture his burgeoning enthusiasm for Artist Development, singing both Lady Waks \\u0026 Rico Tubbs to the label, the latter releasing his classic album \u201cKnuckle Sandwich\u201d on Menu.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the decline of vinyl over the years, Terry decided that this was not going to stop him playing the most up front music he could, so he adopted the Pioneer CDJ 1000. Not only did he master this piece of industry standard kit, but also incorporated tricks and scratches never before seen on the equipment. Like the now infamous \\u0026 crowd pleasing \u201cShoulder scratch\u201d where he picks up the CDJ on his shoulder. \\r\\nTerry\u2019s next step was to form Bass=Win records with Menu Music signee Rico Tubbs.  The label would herald a new era for Terry. Free to peruse a less genre orientated path, Terry dedicated himself and his new label to releasing, playing and making only the best in Bass Music. Bass=Win opened its doors for business in January 2010 with Atomic Hooligans comeback single \u201cBass Crazy\u201d (Later to be remixed on the label by Dubstep Superstars Tek One). All through 2010 the label would release music from such scene giants as Reset!, Tomb Crew, Stupid Fresh, 501, Mightyfools, Filthy Rehab, Aniki and of course Rico Tubbs. In 2011, the label will be releasing music from Wonk, Calvatron and the much anticipated Tubbstep E.P. \\r\\nTerry\u2019s dedication to the bass music sound also saw him become one of the of the founding contributors to the scene defining Bassmusicblog.com. Receiving tens of thousands of hits a day. You could call Terry one of the Bass Music scenes founding farthers.... ??\\r\\nAnd now to 2011, and cementing his dedication to Bass. Terry\u2019s new brain child and project is GRAND RUCKUS along with Lex (Ben \\u0026 Lex). Already remixing for the likes of Top Billin, Tim Healy, Aquasky, Wonk \\u0026 Rico Tubbs. Grand Ruckus will be releasing a Bass / Hip Hop infusion E.P. on Bass=Win early  this Year. Creating a strong image for the brand, Terry with the help of Robert \u201cBobzilla\u201d Page has designed a logo and T shirt range that encompasses the feeling and energy of the music. \\r\\nBut never one to put all his eggs in one basket, Terry has struck out by himself for a series of remixes and original tracks. Most notably his remix of the Dub Pistols classic \u201cSoul Shakin\u201d with Filthy Rehab. \\r\\nTerry is also going back to roots and producing Hip Hop beats for a number of Rappers in 2011. He is also continuing his work with soulful Hip Hop producer Agent Of Change and mixing the Sequel to his 2010 \u201cSummer Beat Tape\u201d, which was also mixed by Terry, and hosted by Wordplay.",

Gathering a tight knit family of similarly soul-centric musicians from his homeland, along with superbly poised Parisian co-vocalist Leslie Phillips, they formed Retrospective For Love London-side and a special force in music was born. \\n\\nRetrospective For Love are a seven-piece band weaving together undeniable, infectious melodies stretching across the stratosphere of Hip-Hop, Soul, and Jazz styles, whilst adding a little 21st century electronic mastery into the mix. Bringing a laid back, comfortable cool to the stage, live performances reach out and grab the spirit \u2013 with a dynamism and natural ear for dance floor groove sitting alongside classic romanticism. \\n\\nAkin to the sound D\u2019Angelo might make tripping out on the heavy grooves of The Roots whilst intoxicated by Robert Glasper\u2019s experimental spirit, Retrospective For Love take the energy of their influences and move it in new directions. Seemingly innocuous lyrics mask tales of love\u2019s most elating and harrowing extremes, capturing the good times, the bad times and all the confusion in between. \\n\\nPlayed out as a symbiotic creative collective of enlightened minds, the tone is always optimistic - forever wedded to pure aural bliss and classic entertainment. \\n\\nA satisfying new sound for a fresh generation of soul lovers.

        "description": "BOOKINGS (WORLDWIDE) - www.constructindustries.com\\n\\nPaul has been on Dance music\u2019s frontline since the release of Leftfield\u2019s debut single \u2018Not Forgotten\u2019 in 1989. With partner Neil Barnes, the duo went onto become one of the most globally successful and respected acts in Dance music, along the way shaping styles and creating sounds that have influenced heavily and been borrowed from literally. As a DJ, remixer and producer in his own right, Paul employs the same approach to being different, fresh and exciting as he has throughout his vocation and the success he has enjoyed has come through an absolute understanding and love of the music, the clubs and the people.\\n\\nPaul spent the late seventies and the early eighties soaking up the wide variety of music that the vibrant gig and club scene of his hometowns of Ramsgate/ Margate offered. This meant he was able to soak up everything from Rock'n'Roll, Punk, bass leaden Reggae rhythms,Disco/Funk, Soul and an emerging post punk underground electronic music scene.\\nAlong with being a drummer with various local Punk bands such as The Rivals and The Need he also ran and DJ'd at his own nights in a basement club on Margate seafront, based around underground european uk/us electronic disco/ Post-Punk/Funk\\nand alike. \\n\\nThe early 80\u2019s were also spent living/moving to  London with underground clubs such as the Dirtbox,\\nLe Beatroute,Mud and Wag clubs along with early warehouse parties in the then derelict east/south of london providing the night-time hangouts and the places to hear old and new/contemporary underground music such as US/UK Funk,Rockabilly,jazz,soul,early 80's US\\\\ UK Electro, Hip-Hop,dub. 70's soundtracks,disco,afro latin,dub, northern soul and unrealised at the time these clubs and happenings were to be the embryonic Balearic/House/scene pre-cursor to the late 80's\\\\early 90's uk rave movement to which Paul was later to be fully involved on a creative musical level.\\n\\nBank Holiday's of the early/mid eighties provided rites of passage weekender trips to Bournemouth and the uk coast for Dirtbox all nighters and daytime sessions again accompanied by a pre-balearic DJ soundtrack.\\nThe mid/late 80's saw Paul working a lot in the Acid Jazz scene run by Eddie Pillar and Giles Peterson,\\nhe  also playing regularly as a percussionist with bands and dj's at Blitz legend Chris Sullivan's Wag club.\\nA trip to the states in the late 80's as session percussionist with the Brand New Heavies enabled him to visit clubs such as The Sound Factory, Red Zone, Save The Robots and many other underground happenings of the NYC club scene of the time, opening him up to the exotic American scene and House music in particular.\\n\\nBack in the UK and Ibiza this new breed of dance music was bubbling away, but it\u2019s highly potent cocktail of repetitive beats and exiting new  electronic sounds would explode on contact with a simmering British boredom and the Ecstasy boom. For Paul, the abundance of music arriving from the States and Europe, the excitement of the clubs and hearing British DJ\u2019s mixing it up and doing things differently persuaded him to become involved in the music and get behind the decks again. \\nPaul was now in demand as a DJ on a UK and international level taking his cutting edge sound around the country\\nand the world as part of the early 90 's wave of superstar dj's to emerge from the london underground scene of the time. \\nHe also played regularly at every main club in Ibiza such as Ku,Space,Pacha,Amnesia as well as playing regularly along side chill out legend Jose Padilla at the sonic sunset temple that is Cafe del Mar.\\nHe held down guest and residency gigs at uk clubs such as Love Ranch,Full Circle,Strutt,Solaris,Ministry of Sound,Renaissance, Back to Basics and many more including regular trips to Naples,Amsterdamn,Japan,Ireland,Scotland,\\nSouth/North America,Australia,Goa,Canada and Europe.\\n\u201cSuddenly at those early Acid-House/Balearic parties, it seemed that everything I\u2019d ever been into came together under one roof,and everything was nice\u2019 Cue Leftfield...\\n\\nIn 1990 Paul was given the opportunity to remix \\",

The only limitation to their imagination was the burgeoning technology, cost, time, and practicality. Now with the advent of digital technology, the only limitation is the imagination, the possibilities are endless, but this now puts a greater importance on the choice of the track to re-edit.\\r\\nMischief Brew have a formula of singling out tracks to re-edit, not just on their individual qualities such as a prominent break, riff or vocal which enables them to extend and re-arrange to fit the mould of the modern dancefloor, but also on the value and recognition they think the track deserves. Their catalogue is a broad church; showcasing soul, reggae, jazz, rock, country, alternative-pop and disco.\\r\\nThe art of re-editing has been around for some time, there has been and still are some great craftsmen, Mischief Brew are certainly up there with the masters.\\r\\n",

Born (Ope Alayande) in March 1990, he was raised on a wide variety of music including jazz, hip hop, disco, funk and soul. His parents got him into Gospel artists like Kirk Franklin, while Fela Kuti was his earliest introduction to Jazz leaning afrobeat music. In his early teens he\u2019d found himself listening to alot of UK Garage and House music through pirate radio sets. Mini Discs, CD\u2019s and Tapes were his initial formats of choice when listening to music. Some of which would prove useful when he started messing around with production on Ejay and an old PC.\\n\\nAround 2007, learning Grime production had become of great interest to him, leading to production in Hip Hop a couple years later. \u201cI always find there\u2019s usefulness in honing both hardware and software production skills\u201d. He founded the HardJazz7 Music Netlabel in 2012 at a time when Electronic and Experimental focused labels were some of the only options for new indie artists/DJ\u2019s producing/creating/DJ'ing Neo-Soul music, Hip Hop music and Jazz leaning beats.

However, having produced loads of keyboard based tracks it\u2019s always nice to go back to the band sound for a change\u2026.especially now I\u2019m completely in charge!\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sunburst Band is a collective born out of Mr Lee\u2019s passion for boogie, funk, disco and jazz. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m the guy who harps on that it was so much better back in \u201978,\u2019\u201d says Dave with a smile, \u201cbut at the same time I\u2019m a bit of a polar resistor who goes against the flow. When my mates were buying The Clash and Cocteau Twins, I was into D Train and Funkadelic. Similarly now as so many dance acts are making electro I\u2019ve gone the other way with this project. I\u2019ve missed the performance thing, the intensity of a band playing together. Rock and indie have never moved away from the guitar and drums sound, whereas dance (be it R\\u0026B or house) tends to be mainly programmed. And it\u2019s not that I have a problem with that, I just wanted to do something that I don\u2019t hear too often nowadays. Some people might call it retro, but I\u2019m just a guy writing songs and performing them with his band.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nForming in 1998, the release of debut album \u2018Here Comes The Sunburst Band\u2019 won critical acclaim with both old school heads as well as nu breed disco and house fans. Tracks like \u2018Garden of Love\u2019 and \u2018Delicious\u2019 became scene classics, championed by DJs from Pete Tong to 4 Hero to Dmitri from Paris. The follow-up \u2018Until The End of Time\u2019 featured cuts like \u2018Far Beyond\u2019 which all the top US hip hop guys still spin, and soul anthem \u2018Everyday \u2013 a favourite with Annie Mac, Trevor Nelson and even Heston Blumenthal, who included it as one of his \u2018Desert Island Discs\u2019 on Radio 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nSays Dave: \u201cThe last album \u2018Moving with the Shakers\u2019 took over me for a while, and I spent 18 months working on it, going back to the songs, honing the production and lyrics, scrapping tracks and starting new ones to make sure there were no fillers. As you can imagine, it\u2019s pretty intense making an album when you\u2019re the main songwriter, producer, label and a\\u0026r man. On this third album, I also wanted to say something in the songs and avoid the banal lyrics that plague so much dance music.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nCollaborators on \u2018Moving With The Shakers\u2019 include Harlem soul legend Leroy Burgess, Diane Charlemagne, who sang on Goldie\u2019s \u2018Inner City Life\u2019, and Chaka Khan\u2019s sister Taka Boom. Fulltime front man Pete Simpson is also known for lending his vocal talents to the Unabombers\u2019 alias, The Elektrons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sunburst Band are currently touring the world while Dave Lee is currently working on the fourth Sunburst Band studio album.\\r\\n",

        "description": "Wave Dweller is the recording name of Mark Newton, an electronic dance music producer, remixer and DJ. His style ranges from chilled out down tempo hip hop, right up to fast paced disco fuelled deep house. His work draws inspiration from a wide range of genres, from classical and opera of the 1920\u2019s, through to 1950\u2019s jazz and soul, right up to rock and pop of the 1980\u2019s. Working from his home studio, these sounds are manipulated, rearranged and woven together to create a nostalgic musical collage reinvented for the dance floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark began producing music from the age of fifteen, and was fascinated with the meticulous process of piecing sounds together from different sources. As his passion developed, he began acquiring industry standard software and equipment to set up a home studio, and from 2006 created work under the name of Wave Dweller.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0003\\u0003Collaborating with unsigned vocalists and rappers, Mark's hip hop production was progressing strongly, and in 2008 a Wave Dweller hip hop instrumental track was featured on Suspect Packages Radio, the UK's largest distributors of hip hop music. In 2009, UK based label Lakeland Records included Wave Dweller\u2019s \u2018Work Play Relay\u2019 on their \u2018Chapter Promo CD 04\u2019 compilation, one of several releases showcasing emerging talent from International artists as well as those from the UK. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0003\\u0003In 2009, Mark signed to Berlin based Mode2 Recordings, where he remixed house tracks for fellow artists on the label. In 2010, he signed to Elliptic Records, a UK based dance label, where he released his debut single \u2018Rat Race\u2019. In 2012, Mark took a more independent route, releasing his debut album \u2018Switchcraft\u2019, which is available as a \u2018name your price\u2019 download.\\r\\n",

        "description": "DJ. Producer. Label Boss. Radio head. East London. House is a feeling!\\n\\nLabels send promos to: pablopromos@gmx.co.uk\\n\\nBiog:\\nPablo del Monte is a house music DJ/producer based in London, label boss at East Recordings and head of internet radio station Brick Lane Radio.\\n\\nAs a youngster Paul Whelan grew up in Ireland listening to his older brother's collection of Chicago house and Detroit techno jams. Keen to experience the scene first-hand he moved to London and his love of dance music got him a job working in the now-defunct south London record store Zone 2 Records. Here he met kindred spirits and started DJing on the London UK Garage pirate radio scene in the early \u2018noughties.  Soon he found himself in the studio with Spatts from UK hip-hop act Criminal Minds and together, as Factor X, they released a number of breakbeat EPs on Carbon Records. Paul's next collab was with Caspar Kedros of Headrillaz fame. As ECT, they had a number of house-infused breakbeat chart hits. Things happened quickly and the guys played clubs like Home, Zap and Fabric, and appeared on Annie Nightingale's BBC Radio 1 show. Over time, their sound morphed into tech-house and their releases on seminal UK label Eukahouse drew support from the likes of Mr C and gigs at London's The End soon followed.\\n\\nAfter much success Paul's partner Caspar began making music for TV.  ECT's hit 'Junk Odyssey' was featured on the US version of the series 'Queer As Folk'. However, this world was not for Paul so he launched his solo career. And thus his moniker Pablo del Monte was born - with the intent of making proper house music! However, he needed to develop his production skills as a solo artist so he enrolled to study at London's famous Pointblank Music School...\\n\\n...and by the time Pablo felt confident of his production standards, serendipitously for him, his first true love, Chicago house, was making waves circa 2013 re-branded, as it was back then, as deep house.  With fellow Pointblank students Pablo set up Brick Lane Radio, which became known for this new house sound. Determined to have full control over his career this time round he set up his own label, East Recordings.  Pablo's early releases like his Maya Jane Cole-esque track 'Glide over Here' gained critical acclaim and was remixed by house don Julius Papp. However, it was his Marshall Jefferson-inspired party house anthem 'House to House' that put Pablo's name on the map after Marco Carola caned the track throughout the summer of 2016 at his Music On night.\\n\\nThe commercial success of 'House to House' led some to think that Pablo's take on house was mainstream but over the coming years his sound became tougher as he released a string of EPs on labels like In Denied Music, Maison Records and Audiophile Deep to name a few; drawing on his experiences of the early London tech-house scene as his point of inspiration.\\n\\nThis year finds Pablo established as one of London's leading DJs with gigs at clubs like Ministry of Sound and his own east London party Throw It Up.  Over the previous few years Pablo was a prolific 'studio rat' with some 30 releases and remixes under his belt. Subsequently he decided to focus less on volume going forward and now releases around 4 high quality EPs per year on select respected labels like his own imprint and on Lupe Fuentes's In The Loop Records so that he can dedicate time to his DJ career and his own club night, as well as to Brick Lane Radio. Although, his tracks feature on so many compilations his actual discography continues to grow exponentially!\\n\\nKnown as a versatile producer with releases in genres ranging from deep house through tech-house to techno all Pablo's productions share that 'house is a feeling' vibe regardless of genre, and with much love shown from the dance music press this DJ - despite his experience - is 'one to watch\u2019.\\n\\n\\",

        "description": "Maximum NRG (The Funky Child): Bhangra and Breaks\\n\\nIn the early 1990s, West London, England was the scene of South Asian kids expressing themselves though music. This sub-culture was marked by two main influences, rural sub-continent lyrics underlaid by jeep beats. This new urban sound had amongst it's ingredients Punjab\u2019s folk music Bhangra combined with US influenced hip-hop. This was the setting we found ourselves in, the DJs known as Maximum NRG (terrible name \u2013 we know). \\n\\nFormed by a few mates from Southall and Hounslow in the early 90s, we had by the end of that decade been lucky enough to be part of a movement that combined the already evolved sound of say Wolverhampton's Sahotas with Brooklyn\u2019s Notorious B.I.G. Friends such as Hustlers Convention, Asian DJ Culture and Ambassadors of Sound were huge critical masses of that scene. \\n\\nThe finest moments of this identity expression was to be found in the weekly schedules of mainstream music clubs, beginning in London that hosted, now almost beyond imagination, nights like Bombay Jungle at The Wag, and the incomparable Hot 'n' Spicy at Shaftesbury Avenue\u2019s disused church: Limelight. Birmingham and Nottingham also stood out with Church Club and Kitsch Club. Suddenly, Bhangra was no longer suburban.\\n\\nThis is reputation that we hope Maximum NRG is remembered for. To have, along with tenacious promoters, brought weekly bhangra nights into the public arena \u2013 we're talking weekly Bhangra in Chinatown! Suddenly the term minority just seems idiotic. Taking music that we were listening to in our cars, homes, weddings and Walkmans and pumping it though the sound rigs at Ministry of Sound, Bagleys and even Britain\u2019s favourite seaside camp site Great Yarmouth, we found that not only was there a market for it but it was based on genuine musical love. Those who we played with, and to, did not wish to make a choice between Jungle, Bhangra, H\\u0026G, R 'n' B and Hip-Hop. \\n\\nThey wanted the diversity - that was and is our British identity. \\n\\nUs? We were just lucky to be available and unemployed and had amongst us a pretty good Mixman - The Funky Child. So, this page is for him and for all those who let us entertain them \u2013 thank you ji for the memories. We may never see their likes again.\\n\\nThank you for allowing us to share some of those mixes that we tried live at clubs with nothing but two decks, a mixer and a mic. One night we even plugged a three band Walkman with low-battery so we could play Bindrakhia\u2019s Dupatta.  We couldn't do any \\",

By the age of 6 he was already playing the drums for the school's morning march and later played for the school band and traditional Ghanaian drums 'Kete'.\\n\\n\\nGrowing up Dada listened to some of the biggest names in Hip Hop and Hiplife. From Busta Rhymes, Timbaland J.Dilla, Missy Elliot, Bukbak, Reggie Rockstone, Lord Kenya and Obrafour are only a handful of his music influences. However, during this time it was more DJ'ing he was interested in. Dada began to DJ at house parties at the age OF 14.\\n\\nDada started producing at the age of 16.

        "description": "Born to rock \u2013 Denis Aleric found his passion for music at the young age of 6.  In the traditional yet modern city, Split, Croatia, was where he was born.  At the age of 16, Denis began playing the guitar for rock and heavy metal bands such as Pandora, Destruction and Essence. After joining the Hare Krishna movement in 1994, Denis expanded his musical talents by playing the harmonium and Indian drum.  After 1999, he left Croatia to travel as a monk to countries such as Switzerland, Germany, India, Italy, Austria, Poland and Romania.  During this time, Denis may have given up many things but music was definitely not one of them.  In fact, his music just became more diverse and original.  Spending 14 years of his life in London, Denis created instrumental songs such as Day Of Joy, Memories, Get Out, amongst many others.  He also created some sound tracks for the Bhaktivedanta Player\u2019s Ramayana and then later recorded the hip hop album When A Soul Acknowledges.  Now Denis lives with his family in Leicester, England where he has just created his new instrumental, Journey Home. All of his songs are composed, produced, mixed and mastered by himself and his motivation and passion for creating new songs shows real dedication and love for music.",

To add to this, the London producer has toured with a large handful of high profile names such as Calvin Harris, The Streets, Professor Green and Example to name a few. \\n\\nFocusing now on his solo career and drawing inspiration from a diverse mix of genres, an eclectic fusion of Hip Hop, Soul and Electronic, S.Chu made his Debut on Copyright Records/Defected with 'Oh My' in 2013 (seeing support from Annie Mac, Toddla T and Sarah Jane who made this her track of the week on 1Xtra). In 2014 his track 'Closure' with soul goddess, Terri Walker was released on Defected and in more recent years S.Chu has released productions on Roger Sanchez's Undr The Radr, In The Loop, SoSure Music, Simma Red and Clueless Music. \\n\\n2017 has marked the launch of his own label, SIXX AUDIO, a home for his own soulful productions which focus on pushing genres and creativity. S.Chu's 'She' EP is out now on the label and showcases S.Chu's edgier sound - something we'll be hearing more of in the near future. With a collection of soulful, stylistic productions lined up on SIXX AUDIO, S.Chu is certainly one to keep an eye on.",

It's always been important to me to fuse genre,s and move as fluidly as possible through different tempos and moods within any individual set. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy taste is fairly widely encompassing, and my sets cater to very different situations. Some can be rampant but dark, dancefloor hammering sound but then my love of ambience, sublety and minimalism tends to come through in my productions and sets away from the dancefloor. I now use Ableton Live, and tend to play quite 'having it' sets of Dubstep, Hip Hop and Jungle when I'm playing in a club, and a real mix of styles when I do the Yardcore radio show on www.subfm.com (You can check out our archives at www.yardcore.net for more sets by me and other members of the yardcore crew).\\r\\n\\r\\nI've been producing since 2008, so early days.. but I'm slowly finding my sound. I hope that you enjoy it. \\r\\n\\r\\n",

Back then I loved my hardcore/breakbeats and started buying vinyl.. Then in 95 started getting into the house and garage scene again buying more and more vinyl and started djing in clubs and playing on pirate radio stations. Around the year 2001 got introduced to the producing side of things by Roger Johnson and have loved it since then.. I'm always trying to drop a bit of the old Skool in my tracks and do try different types of music.. I have been lucky enough to have worked with some great vocalist.. Amanda Hicks, Gema Peel, Mr Arch and Jon Weaton.Currently I'm working with Roger Johnson on some House Music but we are also working on some Hip Hop / RnB.. Hope you enjoy my music..",

So we put on parties in Hoxton, the West End and South London championing this idea and giving people a chance to listen to music from the past, present and future. \\n    As our members grew and developed we all branched off into different directions; Ayah pursued her singing career and formed a 5-piece funk/soul outfit called Slinkyfix, Matt Impact continued to DJ regularly on Rude FM, and decided to form his own label, Revolution Recordings, Guy Nautilus worked in music PR, as a journalist for ATM, Knowledge and Jockey Slut while also playing on Rude FM for 5 years, and Jon Baker pursued a career in Entertainments Law.\\n    As Revolution Recordings gained momentum and support and developed a reputation for putting out music of consistent quality, we felt the need to launch a new imprint which gave us more scope for diversity. Lucky Devil Recordings was launched in 2006 with a 12\u201d from rising star Alix Perez and newcomer Switch and received a warm welcome from a wide spectrum of DJs and punters. \\n    At the moment LDM is being run across the oceans as Guy is based in India and Matt and Ayah remain in the UK. Guy is studying Indian culture and music and researching in the Himalayas whilst working for an NGO, and there will undoubtedly be some eastern influences emerging on LDM releases in the future. Ayah is currently touring with her brand new material and you can catch her live in and around the UK regularly.\\n    Revolution is about to hit release 20 and Lucky Devil is continuing to garner support and release only the choicest of cuts, whilst looking for artists to sign on a long term basis. \\n    ",

In 1998 he started his own quest to find the perfect beat by sampling his parents' vinyl collections and vinyl he bought from second hand shops. After years working as a producer for local crews, things started to get more serious in 2007 when he went to New York to see if his beats could stand the test in the birthplace of Hip Hop. Packed with a bunch of beat CDs (El Pres' Remixtape) he went to all Hip Hop related events he could find and started handing them out to make connections. In 2011 this resulted in the limited edition vinyl release of his Glenwood Hostel EP which featured some of the finest MCs New York has to offer including Nutso, Starvin B and Creature.  El Pres Beats was also featured on the albums Raw Nuts (2008) and Behind These Bars Remixxxed (2013) by Nutso (formerly known as Nut-Rageous). His instrumental debut album Fly Dutchman was released in 2014 on Parisian label Robsoul Jazz.",

Punters and listeners who have come across his mixes have always given him positive feedback and reviews, which he feels far outweigh the monetary side of performing live gigs and is adamant he will always try to channel his addiction into shareable medium. So we can look forwards to free CD\u2019s from Laze Breaks , as long as we are still using CD players.......\\r\\n\\r\\nCHECK THESE LINKS FOR approx 3 DAYS WORTH OF AUDIO*\\r\\n\\r\\n*mixtapes and live shows.

        "description": "DJ/Producer Sarah Young is a multi genre artist, Dubbed by the Guardian as the 'Next Big thing'' and compared to monster producer Diplo and artist M.I.A by MTV, her music is a unique blend of sounds created for the club, influenced by international dance music.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Years:\\r\\nStill a teenager, Sarah\u2019s first break was playing alongside Chipmunk and Natty at a headline show in Tottenham. She has since gone on to play sets internationally at festivals and gigs at destinations such as: New York, Paris, Holland and Lithuania. During her musical journey, she has worked on a variety of projects with artists, producers and DJs such as Toddla T, RedLight, Donaeo, Mz Bratt, Mistajam, Swindle, Jammer, Roses Gabor, David HeartBreak, Lioness, Dynamite MC and J2k.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGrowing up in a musical family, where international sounds filled the house, Sarah recalls her early influences, \u2018\u2019My mother was the talented musical person in the family, playing every instrument from piano, classical guitar to the flute, so I remember growing up listening to the sounds on cassette of jazz, Billie Holiday, Bob Marley, Sergio Mendez as well as classic Indian music, so Ravi Shankar was also a favourite.\u2019\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThis early exposure to music obviously influences Sarah\u2019s DJ sets to this day, \u2018When I was a teenager and started getting weekly gigs, I was djing grime, house, hiphop and reggae - all genres that a London crowd love. But once I started to get international bookings I encountered a variety of producers and Djs who played and edited variations of EDM specific to their country or city, so I became really interested in global bass, and now I play everything from Dutch House, Kuduro, Moombahton, Juke, Trap, Tropical House, Techno, Garage and anything that makes people want to dance. \u2018\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio and Collaborations:\\r\\nSarah has been invited to play several guest mixes on BBC Asian Network and Radio 1xtra, including CJ Beatz m1x show and a VIP guest mix on DJ Kayper's show. Her continuous gig and radio exposure has led to partnerships with high profile brands such as Redbull, Adidas, MTV, WeSC and Westfield Stratford on various projects from CD releases to writing music columns and DJ-ing at store opening parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah Debuted a guest dance show on the famous Ministry of Sound radio on 12th March 2013 featuring world exclusives and interviews from Sway, Ryan Babel and a mini guest mix by Slick Shoota.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction:\\r\\nWhen she\u2019s not spinning, Sarah is in her studio working on a continuous roll of new music releases. She\u2019s already released an EP with Adidas Originals entitled \u2018i am Sarah Young\u2019 and a mix CD with WeSC called \u2018Moombahton Queen\u2019. Following the success of these collaborations, Sarah followed this up with her highly anticipated second solo 3-track EP  Autumn 2012. Retaining elements of her Global Bass roots, the new EP has a bouncier BMP exploring Hip Hop, early 90\u2019s Acid House, Trap, Garage and subsequent EDM genres with guest MCs from across the Atlantic. The EP aimed to make a Global Bass hybrid more relevant to a UK \\u0026 US audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently Sarah is working on a brand new album project. ",

With a bit of help from his friend Rodney Smith, aka Roots Manuva, Jimmy is going to bring a happy mix of Hip-Hop, Bashment, and Dubstep to the mainstream, delivering a very London take on a sound entrenched in a rich, mixed, musical heritage.\\nTry to categorise Jimmy Screech, though, and you won\u2019t get very far. Yes, it's easy to hear that he wears some of his influences on his sleeve (Tipper Irie, Public Enemy, the Wailers, Jay-Z, Bob Dylan), and he is thankful artists such as Sean Paul have made contemporary dancehall go global. But Jimmy is fresh, unique and driven to succeed. \\",

It was just Olly and Tim playing records, it sometimes still is in fact, then we started to work with Mark to make music.\\n    \\n    We have made a debut album, Nonsense In The Dark that's out right now. We have also released some singles and done a bunch of remixes so keep an ear and eye out because they're all rather splendid. In fact you can listen to some of our music right here!\\n    \\n    We run a club night called Kill Em All that has been going for 5 years, this particular disco is held at Fabric. We have had guests like Justice, Erol Alkan, Bloc Party, Crystal Castles, Late Of The Pier, Chemical Brothers, James Murphy, Jackson \\u0026 His Computer Band, Zombie Nation, Schinichi Osawa, Brodinski \\u0026 Simian Mobile Disco. It's a good party.\\n    \\n    Our album, like most personal art forms is a result of our influences, these range from Tangerine Dream to Hot Chip, Can to SMD, Roxy Music to Soulwax, Hip Hop to Krautrock. You know, a bit of old stuff and a bit of modern, plus loads of other things it would take too long to list. We have worked with a collection of artists who we really like and most of them have also played Kill Em All: Samuel Dust from Late Of The Pier, Plastic Little, Brandon Curtis from Secret Machines, Tommy Sparks, frYars, Orlando from The Maccabees, Foreign Islands, To My Boy and Mauro Remiddi from Sunny Day Sets Fire. It a genre-melting electro dance album with an indie heartbeat.\\n    \\n    We have a mixing desk which was made and used by Conny Plank, he was possibly the most important German producer ever, and had a great beard. We also have a ton of old synths which we have used to make this album, Roland Juno 60, Arp 2600, Moog Voyager, Roland Sh101 plus loads of pedals, distortion units and other geeky stuff.\\n    \\n    Ok I reckon that's it for now, we are very excited about our album it took us ages but we love it and hope you do too.\\n    \\n    The best way to hear it is to see our live show, we play quite a lot of it. The dates are on this page somewhere. The live show is damn good so you should really come and experience it for yourself.\\n    \\n    We also have nice bags and a giant 4 foot eye.\\n    \\n    ",

Over the years, I've developed my skills and tastes to take in jazz, funk, breakbeats, breaks, electro, and more recently, drum \\u0026amp; bass, jungle and dubstep. The sound I'm producing now has evolved from the somewhat primative beats I was making at the turn of the millenium (God bless hip-hop eJay 2!) Having taken on a variety of production suites over the years both my style and approach have developed whilst the scope of the music I've listened to has broadened.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy interest in music took an positive turn in 2005, when I took up DJing. My sets have been well received in a variety of venues ranging from intimate house parties, Jazz Caf\u00e9's, club nights, weddings, exhibitions and large festivals across the UK. This in turn has further informed my production, which over the past 2 years has taken on board some of the elements of funk and breakbeat through to glitchy electro, deep ambient/downtempo, dubstep and anything else inbetween.\\r\\nThe thing I prize in music above all is soul. Both in the musical and the spiritual sense. I seek to make music that invites you to think, to dance and to enjoy. I seek to be honest in creating music which expresses my heart and that speaks the truth, both musically and lyrically. Anyway, I hope that you enjoy my productions and feel free to get in touch if you have any questions, or just want to say hi.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace,\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. J.\\r\\n\\r\\n",

Fast forward a year and the ever forward thinking MC is on hIs solo grind with hIs latest solo EP entitled LL COOL J which is his chance to express himself with just the music due for release in August the first offering from the project is a track called 'fresh' which  kind of sums up the whole EP....very fresh.\\r\\n",

Embracing his influences into his musical style which includes Fusion, Electronic, Hip Hop, sounds and rhythms from different parts of the world.\\n\\nWhen Dan was first introduced to the drums at the tender age of 8 by his classical percussionist mother, little did he know where that journey would take him. Being the son of a traveling gospel folk singer/songwriter, certainly ensured that the journey would geographically be far and wide as he accompanied his dad on various travels across many countries. The inevitable result of such travels for Dan is that the musical influences that he has observed and enjoyed from around the world have impacted and informed his playing styles.\\n\\nSince those early beginnings sat at a simple drum kit, Dan's style has embraced Hip Hop genre where he has a number of production credits most notably with acts such as Greenjade, Tor Cesay and Judah \\u0026 Secret which have received national air play and credible reviews. Dan has since then gone on to broaden his influences into his musical style which include fusion, electronic, sounds and rhythms from different parts of the world, which is reflected in his latest album \\",

        "description": "In the late 80's early 90's East London had some amazing breakbeat factories.  This vinyl collection was recorded at the Blockhouse Recording Studio (est: 1987-1994) owned by producer Jezz Wright.   Rare and deleted releases.\\n\\nBlockhouse Recording Studio started out in a terrace house in Leytonstone 1987.  Within a month of its launch the diary was fully booked.  In 1989 it moved to Stratford Workshops, London E15 to purpose built premises where the adventures continued. The shutters came down for the last time in 1994 but not before a wealth of talent had passed through and left their mark.  This is their story - told through the many vinyl releases that made an impression in such a short space of time.   Whilst it\u2019s true that Blockhouse never specialised in just one genre of music, a lot of breakbeat DJ\u2019s \\u0026 artists came here to learn, and craft their skills in the art of music production.\\n\\nI\u2019ve heard many question the narrow formulaic nature of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop or sub-genre associated with the rave era.  Yet Punk, Ska or BritPop is generally applauded \u2013 genres of music that were equally formatted and repetitive in nature. The fact is, no-one can deny the influence UK rave culture has had on every aspect of today's mainstream music and media.  Just like punk, it came along at exactly the right time:  the country was in recession, unemployment was high, the music industry/charts were a joke and the youth of that day felt disenfranchised! The rave scene, with its musical anarchy and entrepreneurial spirit, gave rise to a new generation that questioned the status quo and in doing so, reinvented pop culture. It was probably the last time a youth movement embraced music as a medium for social change \\u0026 influence.  \\n\\nI came across my Discogs listing a couple of years ago that various people had compiled - which inspired me to finally lift the lid on my box of vinyl and find a suitable USB turntable to transfer the recordings.   Many of the recordings on YouTube were pretty poor (substandard/scratched vinyl - basically the pressings weren't meant to last 20 years or so)  I hadn\u2019t heard many of these trax since moving on to pasture new in \u201994  - these tunes were meant for a brief moment in time and for a few - it's a testimony to their legacy that their infludence continues.\\n\\nThese tracks might sound a bit primitive to you now\u2026.  Bit like those old Punk recordings: raw, unmixed, edgy, even a bit unhinged BUT you have to remember the spirit in which they were made and that these tracks were produced without PC\u2019s. There was no internet, no plug-ins, loop libraries or automatic BPM counters.  All were recorded onto multi-track tape ('tape - what\u2019s that?\u2019 asks little Jimmy)  Sample time and quality was er\u2026 \u2018limited\u2019 and most importantly studio time cost artists money!  So these tracks HAD to be produced quickly \u2013 without pretension and with attitude. Loops were often shared, as was my  piano sound, orchestrations \\u0026 fingers - so forgive some similarities - every producer/engineer gives a little piece of themselves and stamps their mark. (whether intended, rewarded or not)\\n\\nSo a big thanks to all who passed by - some amazing memories and artists. Unfortunately some vinyl is too damaged for me to put on here (I'll restore what I can)and I don't have copies of all the releases that came from the studio. \\n\\nFinally, I've only put the breakbeat tracks on here -  So, enjoy the vinyl and if you\u2019ve got a Blockhouse breakbeat recording that's not on here - upload and I'll link to it. (Other recordings of other genres will need to wait for another time :)\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/trueblockhouse\\n\\nPlease note: LowFi (USB Turtable (sorry :) \\u0026 Soundcloud further reduces the quality (128kbps) so that they can stream.   But hey, at least you've found 'em",

With her unique and exciting style, she never fails to keep her listeners on their toes always leaving them wanting more. Possessing adventurism and creative intuition, Jessica prides herself on being an original and innovative artist. Continuously working hard in the studio, Miss Rabbit is soon due to release her first track 'Wave Ryder' - made with her production partner, Richie Fargas.\\r\\nAs well as playing and creating music, Jessica hosts the regular party, SLeeP, with partner Sammie Palm. \\r\\nAs a child listening to her dad spinning the latest reggae tunes at impromptu weekend parties, Jessica knew a life-long love affair with music had begun. Her first regular DJ-ing job came at the tender age of 10, as the resident school disco DJ, where her passion for performance started.\\r\\nShe then discovered clubbing! Over the years she danced her way through London\u2019s underground raving scene, touching many genres, from hip-hop and R'n'B, jungle and drum'n'bass to garage and above all, house. After being so deeply immersed in the music scene for so long, it seemed like a natural progression to start DJ-ing seriously. Jessica got her first taste of mixing house music at an after-party. She took to it instantaneously, immediately acquired a pair of Technics 1200's and from that moment on, she was hooked.\\r\\nIn 2005 she made her professional DJ-ing debut at Meet Bar (next door to Fabric) in Farringdon, London. Since then she has been mixing many house flavours, from deep, minimal, bumpy, electro to jackin and tribal, at some of the hottest clubs.\\r\\nHer growing popularity as a DJ landed her a slot on Unknown FM in 2007, where she gained a considerable amount of radio experience and a number of loyal listeners. After a brief stint at SupremeDance FM, presenting two shows a week in 2009, Jessica was invited on to Centreforce Radio, taking on a Thursday \\u0026 Sunday night show.\\r\\nHer London residencies have included Saturday night at the Mayfair Club, the amazing LipGlosz parties and the Feathers Charity Ball@ the world famous Ministry Of Sound. Jessica has graced over 100 clubs during her short career with her overseas repertoire including ADE (Amsterdam dance Event), WMC (Winter Music Conference Miami), Ibiza, and various venues in North Cyprus, just to name a few. As sideline projects she also works as a voice-over artist and fetish model.\\r\\nIf this has wetted your appetite for Jessica Rabbit why not follow her on Twitter (@DJJessicaRabbit), join her fan page on Facebook (DJ Jessica Rabbit).\\r\\n",

The future looks bright with releases on Metalheadz, Dispatch \\u0026 Horizons imminent and Cyberfunk \\u0026 Shogun potentially coming to fruition. \\n\\nA man of many concepts, Visionobi\u2019s most talked about project to date is his \u201cUnder The Influence\u201d track and video. With the array of track names making up a 64-bar verse, Visionobi managed to create something personal but relevant to the whole scene, whilst highlighting his dexterity as a lyrics man.  \\n\\nMoving on from this, the conceptually obsessed MC started \u201cPicturesque Music\u201d. The idea of the \u201clabel\u201d was to push vocal artists from the D\\u0026B \\u0026 Hip Hop scenes to new realms within their creativity; challenging them to craft a piece of music from a simple image. So far all the music has been put out via youtube and facebook for free, but the future of Picturesque will be to move forward as an official label.\\n\\nSince launching Picturesque, Visionobi has been itching to get back in to the promotional game.

Through working with numerous up and coming acts as a producer he has crafted his own distinctive musical style which infuses his musical ability (playing drums, keys and bass guitar) with a blend of his many inspirations and spans many genres. Joey began composing hip-hop/R\\u0026B tracks but his musical savy and appreciation for music has taken him into dance, soul, reggae, jazz, grime and so much more making him much more rounded as a composer/producer.\\r\\nJoey Stickz has ventured into music licensing following music placements in TV productions and is always working on expanding his ever-growing catalogue of music.

Having been influenced by a diverse range of urban rap acts, he wrote from the perspective of a British-born Asian representing on the microphone and detailed reflective accounts on society, current affairs and issues. \\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, dedication prevailed, culminating in a meeting with legendary Asian DJ/producer, the Xzecutive San-J Sanj. His first break was being featured on San-J Sanjs Club Bomb-Bass show on the pioneering BBA Radio. Though initially only commissioned for a one-off appearance, he became a regular during Sanjs 4 week slot, with freestyles and verses over top Hip-Hop beats. Having continued to do gigs with Sanj and Ameet Chana and appearing alongside top DJ acts, Sanj and Swami eventually got together in the studio to record the hit track Where U @ Bro, which received substantial airplay from BBC Radio 1, BBC 1Xtra, Kiss 100, Galaxy FM and BBC Asian Network.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the success of the tune, Baracus performed at the UK Asian Music Awards press launch event and was the first Asian rapper to be featured on the UK Dubstate segment on DJ Excalibah's legendary 'Tales From The Legend' Hip-Hop show on BBC 1Xtra. \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving won the 2006 Asian 8-Mile MC Battle contest at Radio 1 DJ Nihal's monthly clubnight 'Bombay Bronx', Baracus has since featured on hit tracks 'One Blood UK', 'My Shoes', 'Brown Boys', 'This DJ' and 'United We Stand', as well as performing at numerous events across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a brief hiatus, SB released a comeback single, 'Break This Game', which received huge critical and commercial acclaim. The video was Number 1 on the BritAsia TV Chart Show, and the subsequent Hindi version has been playlisted on BBC Radio 1 and radio stations abroad.

From the age of 11, Kitty Amor began to read music and started playing the drums in order to master the basic sounds of music and develop her musical ear as well as expand her knowledge to how different sounds could be created. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a young age, Kitty grew up listening to Motown soul, underground hip-hop, RnB and jazz; but as she matured in music, she took a liking to the sound of garage and broken beats as it was niche, different and a combination of the music that was seen to be commercial. Ageing with her love for garage, Kitty ventured into House music from the age of 16 listening to producers such as Frankie Knuckles, Masters at Work, Kerri Chandler and Carl Cox (to name a few). With her brothers hanging the headphones and packing up their decks, Kitty knew it was time to take over and keep the light of music shining throughout the family for many more years. Age 18, Kitty Amor pursued her talent and began deejaying. From being a promoter in the Midlands, she had built connections with the entertainment and music scene to put her on a platform to take deejaying seriously. As years went on, Kitty felt at home behind the decks, in front of a dancing crowd, playing music that touches the soul and this is where she established herself as a dj specialising in deep and soulful house. Her musical style had been differed from many others as she plays soul-hitting house music but brings endless amount of energy behind the decks and involves the crowd in each of her sets by dancing along delivering her joy to being the music supplier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough her mix compilations (House Es Amor \\u0026 Appreciation), Kitty has continued to establish her sound in the UK, expand her fan-base and never fails to disappoint whenever/however she is heard. Following the success of these releases after achieving over 700+ plays, Kitty caught the eye of the UK's leading Afro-House DJ, Sef Kombo, who gave her the chance to shine in 2012 at one of the strongest house events called Til Two in London. Kombo (who plays on Bang Radio and BBC 1xtra) used this opportunity to heighten Kitty's success and take her under his wing as his first protege.\\r\\n\\r\\nKitty Amor continues to move away from the typical expectations of a dj and deliver the unexpected to all lovers of music.",

This had a huge impact on him because he learned to appreciate types of music that without his dad influence he would probably only develop on a distant future. \\n\\n\\nHe always states: \\n\\n\u201c..People should try to listen to everything as a result they will be able to differentiate between normal and top productions, singers and songs and also acknowledge what they really like and suits their individual interests..\u201d\\n\\nAlthough back in the days the most played genres of music were Semba, Kizomba and Kuduro on his country (Angola), Hip-Hop, Jazz and many others have and still being highly consumed by this little boy that were already developing a passion for music without noticing. \\n\\nBeing on a environment were music was somehow always present did influenced firstly to become a wise listener and the possibility to see and listen to some of his older cousins that already used to play back on the days have somehow awake the desire of this little boy to take a step further. \\n\\nChill Out Luanda had a tremendous importance for the knowledge about this specific genre of music (house music) because this was one of the major places in the capital that played this type of music all night long. At that time Chill Out Luanda brought massive artists to Angola such as: Pete tha Zouk, Mc X\u00e9nia, Dj Chus, Di Paul, Diego Miranda, Mastiksoul, Barbara Tucker, Luna Ricci, Dj Gregory, Louie Vega, Anane, Martinez Brothers to name a few of the artists that he had the opportunity to listen/view there.\\n\\nIn 2006 he really started to have contact with controllers and playing for friends at home. A year later he started to play in parties for his school colleagues and close friends that were organized in that time. In the final of 2007 with their 3 brothers and one sister they had create Warm Up Sessions that is connected with parties and music but does not relates only to that. \\n\\n(See Information bellow)\\n\\nSince the end of 2013 he has being responsible for dropping monthly volumes carrying his brand (Warm Up Sessions) here on souncloud. \\n\\nHe states some of his unquestionable influences as: Frankie Knuckles (The GodFather of House), Carl Cox, Bob Sinclar, Erick Morillo, Tiesto, Black Coffee, Dj Kent, Swedish House Mafia, Avicii and others.\\n\\n\\nUPDATING!\\n\\n(MORE INFO COMING SOON)\\n\\nBooking Contacts:\\n\\n+447724418477 - United Kingdom\\n+351914796476 - Portugal\\n+244923591140 - Angola\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The album was mixed and recorded entirely in Smith\u2019s bedroom and features an array of musical styles with a unique blend of Breakwell\u2019s booming soulful voice and Smith\u2019s quick and sharp raps.\\n",

Futuron.\\n\\nCombining folk and hip-hop with other musical influences creeping in, they find it hard to describe their sound. In terms of how they go about making songs, Tony handles all live instrumentation and also sings while Frank programs drums and bass and does the remaining vocals.\\nTheir work is a collaboration that starts with a small rift or idea for a theme and is developed by the both of them into fully realised songs.\\n\\nIt has been a trip outside both their comfort zones but one they have found both rewarding and fun and they are already plotting a return to the Clapton HQ for more recording!\\n\\nThey sincerely look forward to hearing people's opinions and finding out if other bands are moving in the same direction...\\nDownload our Ep at the above bandcamp link!",

        "description": "Jazz musician, electronic producer, session musician and educationalist.\\n\\nBIO\\nSean Khan was born in London and began playing clarinet and saxophone from the age of 11. Some years later he began the study of flute and private harmony lessons from Lionel Griegson. When Sean left school he began to work professionally as a freelance musician who specialized mainly in jazz, though he had been strongly influenced by all genres of urban music (dance, hip hop and drum n bass and Latin). However, he soon found work as a recording artist with the likes of Martin Virgo (Nellie Hooper\u2019s production team, Mono) and Ernest Mckone (Galliano, Push, Paul Wellar).  It was through his association with Ernest Mckone that he released his first dance record, which proved to be successful and led to many other recording opportunities .\\n\\nSean has sent a demo of a soul album for Sony records, that wasn\u2019t accepted by the label. However the demo strongly impressed Mike Slocombe from Goya records and they asked Sean to form a band. This band became known as SK radicals and the first single \u2018Reachin 4 da Farside\u2019 became hit. Sean teamed up with Bugz in the Attic to produce the first SK radicals album, \u2018When will we belong\u2019. The success of this record enabled Sean to build his own studio, which he produced the second SK radicals record, \u2018Urban Ecletiks\u2019.\\n\\nWith the SK radicals Sean has worked with a number of notable musicians and groups such as Bugz in the Attic, Mark de Clive Lowe, Kaidi Tathum, Daz I Que, Recloose, Derrick McIntyre (Roy Ayres, Incognito). \\n\\nAnd now to the present, Sean has always been steeped in Jazz and it was only a matter of time before he put together an acoustic jazz Project.\\n\\nIn \u2018Slow Burner\u2019, Sean\u2019s first release on Far Out recordings, featuring Tim Lapthorn, Mike Edmonds, Laurie Lowe, Genevieve Grant and Susan Allotey. The album features some of the best young jazz musicians in London\u2019s and Europe\u2019s jazz scene.\\n\\nSean Khan has performed/recorded/played with a number of international artists, such as Bheki Mseleku (Joe Henderson, Elvin Jones Groups), Clifford Jarvis (the last John Coltrane Group) from the world of Jazz and Lisa Stansfield, Jocelyn Brown (Incognito), Mica Paris, The Beastie Boys from the pop world. Sean has performed on many sessions in a variety of different set ups. As already stated he is also the producer and founder of the \u2018cult electro funk group\u2019 (Jazz Caf\u00e9 magazine). \u2018SK radicals\u2019 which number the great bass player Derek Mckintyre as a member (Jamiroquai, Roy Aryers and the Jazz Crusaders). Sean has performed at the Nancy jazz festival, Douro jazz festival, Rivoli theatre (Porto jazz festival), Jazz Caf\u00e9 (London), Cargo, ICA, Jamboree (Barcelona), Jazz Caf\u00e9 (Havanna Cuba, leading his own quartet of Cuban musicians), Edinburg festival and many other venues in Europe, he has toured Scandinavia, Switzerland and France.\\n\\nThe album \u2018Slow Burner\u2019 represents Sean\u2019s journey back to one of his main loves, Jazz improvisation. His playing pays homage to Coltrane, Henderson, Parker and Shorter and there is also a vocal tribute to Stevie Wonder. \u2018What is Jazz?\u2019 is a political statement delivered via the spoken Word artist Genevieve Grant (San Francisco spoken Word scene) where she recites an essay about what jazz is and what is becoming of it? The group sound gives a nod to the contemporary (hip hop, drum n bass) but also to the hard swing of New York and the almost free sound of Europe.",

        "description": "Back in 2008, musician/producer Broadcaster took samples from the award-winning 1960s BBC Radio Ballads series and gave them a radical makeover on his debut EP Primary Transmission. By blurring musical genres, Broadcaster jumped through time to bring this music to a fresh set of ears and Primary Transmission was played on BBC Radios 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. The single \u2018England\u2019 immediately became Colin Murray\u2019s Record of the Week on his BBC Radio 1 show.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Broadcaster\u2019s back, pushing the boundaries once again with his first full-length album, Folksploitation out on Red Grape Records on 30th July 2012. Featuring the unlikely juxtaposition of the vocals of folk icon Peggy Seeger and Broadcaster\u2019s dub, hip hop, funk and techno beats, it turns the highly improbable into the possible, the traditional into the experimental and a conundrum into artistry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lead single First Time Ever sees Broadcaster working his magic on one of the best-known songs of all time, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face. And the twist? The song was written by Ewan MacColl for the 21-year-old Peggy herself. Now in her mid-70s, Peggy was delighted to subject herself to the Broadcaster treatment.",

Cutting his teeth as a featured vocalist, producer and musician he has worked with some of the UK's biggest talents. Now it's D.ablo's turn to take centre stage with the release of his debut album 'The Retrospective'.\\n\\nBorn and raised in East London on a diet of grunge, calypso and jazz, D.ablo is a product of his environment and an exception to the musical rules, combining mainstream charisma with underground originality. Influenced by everyday life and his open-minded musical taste, he writes anthems that have both immediate appeal and slow-burning hidden qualities.\\n\\nD.ablo first came to the public\u2019s attention as a member of the\u00a0legendary UK hip hop crew TerraFirma, making a name for himself\u00a0thanks to his unique vocal style and multi-instrumental abilities. Since\u00a0then he has\u00a0worked with a diverse group of artists including NERO, Maceo Plex, Alix Perez, Paloma Faith, Foreign Beggars\u00a0(recently performing with them on the single 'Anywhere' at the iTunes Festival at London's Roundhouse), 16Bit, Ayah Marar and Noisia.\\n\u00a0\\nD.ablo also makes up one half of the Sleeping Giants production unit with fellow TerraFirma graduate Skriblah DanGogh.\\n\u00a0\\nHis underground party and record label Boglewaltz is known for its eclectic music policy and fun-loving crowd. Recent guest performers have included Damian Marley, Aloe Blacc, Questlove, Benji B and MistaJam.\\n\\nOn 'The Retrospective', D.ablo showcases his talent alongside the producers he learned his craft with, moving between acoustic singer songwriter material, steel drum solos, emotional ballads and striking harmonies with the confidence of an artist sure of his roots but always looking to expand his musical horizons.\\n\u00a0\\nWith an upcoming release schedule of new material, fresh collaborations and live appearances this album is really just the beginning of D.ablo's adventures as a solo artist...",

        "description": "QUICK NURSE, THE SCREEN!\\r\\nAfter a generation of duos, the power trio is back, hotwired into the 21st century in the startling new form of SCREEN. But, where the threesome lineup, first propagated in the mid-60s by the likes of Cream, used guitar, bass and drums to rattle the roof, ALEX PATERSON (The Orb), GAUDI and CHESTAR have conjoined to tear down the walls, powered by mutual obsessions with dub\u2019s bass-propelled dislocation of the norm, except used as a springboard.\\r\\nIt was a love of dub reggae which first brought Alex and Gaudi together, the ever-questing pair bonding over remixes and a monumental back-to-back soundclash on the former\u2019s Chewy Chewsdays radio show on fnoob.com. Studio collaboration was inevitable so, joined by percussionist-vocalist Chestar, who Alex knew from his time in an early 80s incarnation of Youth\u2019s Brilliant, they embarked on the intense series of recording sessions which have resulted in 'WE ARE SCREEN!.', one of the most startling creative and turbulent albums of the new decade. Where technology often seems to squeeze the original passion and maverick dam-busting spirit out of music, Screen have appeared to rough and dub things up, both in homage to this most anarchic musical form, while also plugging into the kind of syncopated creative emotion which fuels great music.\\r\\nBoth Alex and Gaudi are already renowned as fearless aural trailblazers with many successes under their belts. Navigated by Alex, the Orb morphed out of the late 80s acid house explosion to become UK album chart-toppers and top ten space invaders, establishing a name for spectacular intergalactic whoopee, while displaying an often criminally-overlooked knack for bringing together idiosyncratic musical forms and often-unwitting avant garde attitude [underpinned by the eternal subliminal question, \u2018What would King Tubby do?\u2019]. Just the last 18 months have seen Alex collaborate with Thomas Fehlmann as the Orb on the evocative Baghdad Batteries, with Dom Beken on the future hiphop soundtracks of High Frequency Bandwidth\u2019s Hell Fire And Brimstone and Shooter 2 soundtrack, and with Pink Floyd\u2019s Dave Gilmore and Youth for the Metallic Spheres project, which boasted a Gaudi remix. Alex\u2019s early work has also been heard again recently on the reissue of Primal Scream\u2019s Screamadelica, on which he supplied the stratospheric mix of \u2018Higher Than The Sun\u2019.\\r\\nWhile most reading this will be aware of Alex\u2019s enormous story, Gaudi packs an equally as eventful tale after cutting his musical teeth in his native Italy\u2018s new wave/punk scene during the early 80s. His reggae epiphany came soon after and he quickly sharpened his production skills while opening his soul to the infinite vistas of Jamaican music.  A few years later  Polygram released his first solo album Basta Poco (Italy\u2019s first home-grown raggamuffin outfit) and the follow-up Gaudium Magnum which led to several years touring with reggae artists including Jimmy Cliff, The Wailers, Third World, Yellowman, Shinehead and Ziggy Marley. Gaudi moved to London in 1995 and set up his Metatron Studio [where he still creates and the seeds of the Screen ejaculated into bloom]. Collaborations commenced, including Terra Terra with DJ Angelino, remixing Cool Jack\u2019s \u2019Jus\u2019 Come\u2019 to pole position on the UK dance charts, and further mixes over the years including Lamb, Simple Minds, Afrika Bambaataa, Mansun, Cast, Apache Indian, Zion train, Artful Dodger and Scissor Sisters to name a few. He has also written movie soundtracks and theatre plays, while his solo career continued with third album Earthbound, which brought in world music giants, and then Bass, Sweat \\u0026 Tears emerged from time he spent immersed in Africa. The Orchestral World Groove collaboration with DJ Pathaan resulted in four years touring the world, while he continued working with anyone from Simple Minds\u2018 Jim Kerr to hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Flash to reggae legend Horace Andy. 2006 saw him teaming up with legendary ambient producer Peter Namlook on their Re:sonate album, 2008 with Lee Perry on his Bob Marley refurbishment project, and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on Dub Qawwali album which gained a nomination for the BBC World Music Award. Gaudi\u2019s fertile relationship with Alex started after the former remixed \u2018Vuja De\u2019 off the Orb\u2019s The Dream album then Metallic Spheres feat David Gilmour, while the pair have also embarked on remixing classic tracks from Trojan Records\u2019 monumental catalog.\\r\\nChestar has been present in the South London Orb-related axis since the early 80s, arriving from the North-East, first as percussionist in Brilliant, the band formed by Youth after Killing Joke\u2019s runner to Iceland [Their later guitarist was Jimmy Cauty, promoted from sound man to band member on Chestar\u2019s insistence, paving the way for his explosive exploits in the K.L.F. after meeting Bill Drummond as a result].\\r\\nIt was quite a long way from the ten-year-old kid who\u2019d been thrown off the set of a Campbell\u2019s soup commercial by legendary director Fellinii, when he was ten years old. In 1967, his ten-sibling family won a competition to star in the advert, made around the time Andy Warhol was turning the soup cans into objets d\u2019art and shown on TV for two years. Chestar first gig was as 19-year-old drummer for John Lee Hooker\u2019s bassist Smudger Smith, then percussionist for the nascent Tourists in 1977, alongside Dave Stewart and Pete Coombes. He recalls young singer Annie Lennox\u2019s audition, but was commendably thrown out for taking the piss out of Stewart. Now ensconced in London, Ches hung out with Joe Strummer, Tymon Dogg and the Maida Vale squatting fraternity.\\r\\nChestar first gig was as 19-year-old drummer for John Lee Hooker\u2019s bassist Smudger Smith, then percussionist for the nascent Tourists in 1977, alongside Dave Stewart and Pete Coombes. He recalls young singer Annie Lennox\u2019s audition, but was commendably thrown out for taking the piss out of Stewart. Now ensconced in London, Ches hung out with Joe Strummer, Tymon Dogg and the Maida Vale squatting fraternity, before relocating to the remote Welsh mountains. He later gravitated to Brilliant\u2019s West London HQ, replacing drummer Andy Anderson [who went on to the Cure, Jeffrey Lee Pierce and Iggy Pop], playing percussion and drum machines at their gloriously chaotic gigs, bringing Jimmy into the band, while hitting it off with Alex through mutual love of breaks and beats. Brilliant had three singles produced by SAW, the Chestar-penned \u2018Somebody\u2019 one of their most successful, getting to number 20.\\r\\nAfter Brilliant dissolved, like many others, Chestar caught the rave bug, involved in putting on events like Sunrise. By now, Youth had built a mini-empire around his Dragonfly operation, Chestar plugging into the psy-trance vibe. After experiencing an epiphany in India that a raga is similar to a Celtic reel, he reinvented himself as Baba G for Youth to produce \u2018Dig A Jig\u2019, only kept off the top spot by the Rednex\u2019 \u2018Cotton-Eyed Joe\u2019 in 1995. Chestar then spent five years in Japan, promoting raves and managing a didgeridoo band. Between 2001-03, he also promoted the legendary Samothraki electronica festivals in Greece, raided when he wouldn\u2019t pay bribes, resulting in jail and deported to the UK, where he worked as festivals production manager. Most recently, Chestar wrote and sang lyrics for two tracks on Younger Brother\u2019s Last Days Of Gravity album.\\r\\nTo quote Joe Strummer, a cog in the universe shifted somewhere when Chestar set up a meet between Alex and Gaudi, putting down beats as the creative collision between the pair turned into a hyper-sparking particle shower of new music. Gaudi remixed \u2018Vuja De\u2019 off the Orb\u2019s The Dream album, then Metallic Spheres feat David Gilmour, while remixing classic tracks from Trojan Records\u2019 monumental catalogue with Alex. But, for the last few months, Screen has been evolving fiercely, now resulting in the new album.\\r\\nWhile its ten tracks sport recognizable elements from previous signature sounds, the spirit of collaboration turns the album into a three-way odyssey leaving musical barriers as distant specks on the horizon, the afore-mentioned dub pulsing in the lower reaches or splintering vocals, which sometimes use vocoder effects to lend a cold, futuristic sheen to the messages.\\r\\nAfter the swirling pulsations of \u201915 minutes\u2019 and intoxicating strings and contagious bongos of \u2018Frog Time\u2019, the album ventures into the orchestral dronescape of \u2018Gone phishing\u2019 before the sugar-rush monotone funked-up robo-rap of \u2018Just outside\u2019. The electronic wind effect of \u2019Perfect\u2019 turns loose a slo-mo dub-funk behemoth, goosed by sinister narrative which continues as Giorgio Moroder operates from the Clockwork Orange chemical toilets on the post-apocalyptic city prowl of \u2018Section by section\u2019. Crucial dub hoists its mighty bass appendage on \u2018Smokescreen\u2019, before \u2018Weather will be bigger than war\u2019 continues the reggae celebrations, which reverberate into the closing version of Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u2018What a wonderful world\u2019, which manages to mate ricocheting tablas with Maytals-style rock steady skank, Satchmo\u2019s gorgeous song providing an optimistic, uplifting finale after the gamut of panoramic visions which have just transpired, leaving no doubt that the Screen is up.

His father being a prolific Reggae \\u0026 Rare Groove vinyl collector and his brother being on the pulse with all what was going on in Hip Hop, helped to cement BMJ\u2019s love and passion for music. During his teens he avidly began collecting both US and UK Hip Hop music until he discovered the emerging sounds of early Drum \\u0026 Bass / Jungle. Record shops such as; Blackmarket Records, D.V.Ant Records \\u0026 Sounds Good located in South London was where he then spent a large proportion of his spare time over the next few years, building a large collection of vinyl of his own.\\n\\nDeejaying presented itself to BMJ as an inevitability so a studio set up soon materialised and before long BMJ\u2019s skills were finding attention and he began hosting shows on radio stations such as Rinse FM, Kool FM, Rude FM, Ruud Awakening, Origin FM and a host of others. Club bookings also ensued with appearances at venues such as the Brixton Academy, Stratford Rex, Colloseum, Hidden, Bagley\u2019s, Mass + many more, as well as appearances at Glastonbury Festival, United Festival Notting Hill Carnival plus many more.\\n\\n....\\n\\nJo\u0161 od najranijih dana BMJ je \u017eivio glazbu, stoga nije iznena\u0111uju\u0107e da se dijete ritma pretvorilo u kolekcionara, DJ, glazbenika, vlasnika vi\u0161e labelova i organizatora partija. Njegov otac skupljao je Reggae i Rare Groove vinile, a brat mu je bio u sredi\u0161tu hip hop scene. U tinejd\u017eerskim je danima boravio u \u201cSounds Good\u201d shopu u Londonu i gradio svoju oazu vinila i zvuka US i UK Hip Hopa, Drum\\u0026Base-a i Jungle-a. Sljede\u0107i korak bio je DJing, vodio je i emisiju na piratskom radijima kao \u0161to su  Kool FM, Rude FM, Ruud Awakening, Impact i mnogim drugima. U klubovima d\u017eungle betona rasplesao je mnoge, od Brixton Academy, Stratford Rexa, Colloseuma, Hidden, Bagley\u2019s, Mass i Asyluma. Od svih gigova u srcu najvi\u0161e mu se urezao nastup na epskom Glastonburyju, a pamti i nastupe na Notting Hill Carnivalu i Cannabis Carnivalu.\\n\\nhttps://soundcloud.com/jamma\\nwww.dubclinique.com\\nwww.twitter/jammadj\\nwww.facebook.com/deejayjamma\\nwww.mixcloud.com/jamma\\n\\nAIM: jammadubclinique\\nSKYPE: jammadc",

        "description": "Blending elements of alternative rock, and socially conscious hip hop, State of Play wear a healthy disrespect for genre boundaries on their collective sleeve.  Crossing seamlessly from the neo-soul swagger and urban vibes of The Roots, to the wearied tenderness of Lauryn Hill, to the thrashing drive of Rage Against the Machine and The Pixies \u2013 State of Play prove that you don\u2019t have to play it safe to be accessible. \\n\\nGiven the melting pot mentality at heart of the band\u2019s sound, it\u2019s perhaps surprising that in the context of their tight, powerful compositions it\u2019s the similarity rather than the diversity of their influences that shine through. The fine-tuned formula of mixing insightful lyrics and anthemic chorus hooks with infectious grooves that you can't stop yourself nodding along to, has proven to be a success. \\n\\nThis is especially evident in the live arena, where the front trio of Anthony (A-Mens) Mensah, Hydieku Warwick and Ahmar (S.V) Ferguson never fail to win the crowd over. Meanwhile, guitarist Alex (Fando) Fernandes applies his prodigious talent with unreserved glee and the rhythm section (Damien Ricaud on bass and Ben Spooner on drums) clearly enjoy surfing their shared wavelength. Taken together, it\u2019s enough to convert even the most stoic, cross-armed cynics into bouncing believers well before the encore.\\n\\nDelivering a message that genuinely seems to resonate with the masses, the group clearly belong to a tradition that sees music as a weapon, with their sonic cross-over credentials proving the perfect vehicle for the band\u2019s social commentary. There\u2019s an infectious sort of joy you usually only find in people who truly believe in their work. State of Play have it in droves. Combine that with an uncompromising fighting spirit and you have a recipe for something truly memorable.\\n\\n\\nLead Guitar: Alex (Fando) Fernandes\\n\\nBass: Damien Ricaud\\n\\nDrums: Ben Spooner\\n\\nVocalists: Ahmar (S.V) Ferguson \\u0026 Hydieku Warwick\\n\\nRapper: Anthony (A-Mens) Mensah",

        "description": "Singing has always been the first passion for Sweet Ambition, highly influenced by her father, who was a musician.\\nDuring her teenage years Sweet Ambition attended various talent competitions and would sing anywhere she could. Writing her own songs came natural to her, she would note down her thoughts and feelings as poems and they soon turned into songs. Later Sweet Ambition started to create her own digital music productions with the help of her fiance whom is a music producer. Sweet Ambition experiments with multiple genres, such as Soul, Dance \\u0026 Jazz. She uses her music to express her thoughts and feelings and believes 'it\u2019s not always easy to put your heart and soul into words, but when it needs to be set free, it comes without any thought at all'. \\nGrowing up, Sweet Ambition has been influenced by many artists across multiple genres such as Whitney Houston, Sade, Nina Simone, Alicia Keys, Aaliyah, Lauryn Hill, Michael Jackson, Prince and Lenny Kravitz.  Sweet Ambition is currently working on her first EP due to be released in August 2017. This album will offer something different from her previous works and will be more focused on the R\\u0026B and Hip Hop genre.",

With Michele at the production helm, the group scored 2 UK Top 10 singles and 1 UK Top 20 album.\\n\\nIn dance music, he is best known for his work as a keyboardist on hundreds of productions by some of the top DJs and dance acts in the world including Dave Lee (a.k.a.

In 1994, trip hop emerged from Bristol, which combined elements of hip hop beats, drum and bass breaks, and ambient atmospheres at a lower tempo. At the end of 1990s a more melodic instrumental electronica incorporating acoustic sounds with electronic styles emerged under its own umbrella name of downtempo.[2]\\n\\n\\nNow in the year 2012 we bring you Pauze recordings a london based\\neclectic chill/dowtempo or what ever you choose to call it label, but\\nthe very one thing you won't be able to do is to label it, the music\\nand artist are 100% free to create what ever comes to mind and spirit,\\nIn todays world were there are so many rushing and fighting to get\\nfrom place to place we ask you to just slow down for a moment and\\nPauze with us,\\nThe order of the day is trust the beauty in the sound, from all out\\ninstrumentals to full on vocals really dosent matter as its just about\\nthe flow of the oneness,\\nThe Pauze website and FB page and twitter pages will follow shortly as\\nwe thought we'd put up 4 tracks just to wet the appetite as theres a\\nhost of amazing music in store,\\n\\nSo please take a moment and Pauze with us.",

Hailing from East London, Ashleigh\u2019s passion for music was evident at a very early stage in life when acquiring a Technic turntable from his uncle at the tender age of 4. Since then Ashleigh has been a avid music listener and vinyl collector drawing influences from Jazz, Funk, R\u2019n\u2019B, Dub Reggae \\u0026 Hip Hop. Within his teenage years, dance music played an intricate part for where he is today. The sounds of House \\u0026 UK Garage in the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s put together the pieces for where Ashleigh\u2019s sound lies now. In a very short amount of time within 2011, Ashleigh has emerged behind the decks at some of London\u2019s most respectable nightspots including Egg, Public Life, Warehouse \\u0026 Vibe Bar playing his unique interpretation of Deep Techno House. A typical Ashleigh De-Niro set would include energetic raw edged deep driven spontaneous grooves with sonic tech layers. Ashleigh is currently hosting his weekly radio show 'The Abyss Show' on London's leading underground station Project FM 106.5/ www.projectfmlive.co.uk on Wednesdays at 8pm - 10pm where his experimental  flavor of underground music is displayed.",

        "description": "\\nBio Born in London, England 1985, The north Londoner known as Kasino aka \u2018It\u2019s A K-thing\u2019, has proven to be the most dynamic, unique artists within UK music scene. Rapper, songwriter, producer Kasino, began his music journey late in life only starting at 18, Though hip-hop /Rnb wasn\u2019t his first love, he adapted to the lifestyle and related to it very rapidly, and has not let that stop him from matching up with key stars that spent years to develop on there game. With his great consistent attitude, and unique way of thinking, he has created within these short 5years close to 30 full track album styled mixtapes. Which with each one has developed him as an artist. He keeps pushing himself to improve, and progress, for him there is no limit, or goals he can\u2019t achieve. Kasino`s music reflects on all his characteristics, and emotions. Which gives him an edge to write songs about anything he\u2019s experienced in life, whether comedic or serious. Known For his own unique slogan, \u2018it\u2019s a k -thing \u2018 which means for him \u201cit\u2019s my way, my style, it\u2019s all k\u2019, shows he is a person that don\u2019t care what you think of his music sound, because he\u2019s just doing him, from production /flow /lyrics to swagger. Inspired and compared to the likes of US artist Eminem, D.M.X, and Will Smith, shows Kasino he\u2019s not your average every day rapper. Who\u2019s interests or inspirations come from your typical 2 Pac /B I, G / Jay-z /Nas, shows he has something new to bring to the table, an thus proven that, to many that has had the chance to listen to his music over the period of time.",

From the very first day they shook hands they knew it was love.\\n\\u2028The band started jamming in a West London pub and developed an eclectic sound: a mix of rap, heavy guitar riffs, funk bass lines, crispy saxophone melodies, elements of gypsy jazz and electronica, using spaceship-pedalboards and crazy effects. \\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s new age and extremely entertaining.\u201d - Sound and Motion Magazine\\n\\nAll four Onironauts grew up in families of musicians who lived and breathed gypsy jazz, electronic party music, dirty metal and old hip-hop. Rich and diverse musical backdrops provided an ideal breeding ground for these musical hunter gatherers.\\n\\nMaking hardly any recorded music available to their fans, The Onironauts are focused on creating an unmissable live show. Humorous and innovative, their gigs often feature artists doing live painting on stage. The band have already toured the length and breadth of Europe, including tours in Russia, earning support slots with The Correspondents and Rudimental along the way. \\n\\nNews of this \u201cmusicians' band\u201d travelled to The Animal Farm, who, having seen the band tear the roof down at the Dublin Castle in Camden, offered to make a record on the spot. The first fruits of their collective labour come in the shape of four singles that flout every rule of what is acceptable and admissible. \\n\\n\u201cThe Onironauts have come to blow our minds with things we didn\u2019t think were possible. Highly weird but so right.\u201d \\n- Showmesomethingdifferent.com\\n\\nThe Onironauts release their debut single \\",

His music fuses popular genres such as RnB, Soul, Pop and Hip Hop, creating a refreshing and captivating individual sound, whilst maintaining a calculated balance between credibility and commercial appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn into a musical family, Ryan\u2019s early life was influenced by a multitude of artists and bands, such as Led Zeppelin, U2, Prince, Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, The Eurythmics, George Michael, Boyz II Men, Queen and Sam Cooke. The variation and depth of music he absorbed as a child would serve to inspire and shape his future.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan\u2019s earliest breakthrough was 'Prisoner' a song inspired by domestic violence, a subject close to his heart. The track received huge positive attention and quickly raised awareness of his emergence as a songwriter and artist. As a result, he soon united with writer/producers Zay \\u0026 D Entertainment, who began work with Ryan to create an exciting portfolio of new songs. The track 'Stop Drop Roll\u2019 was broadcast nationwide on Sky TV.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan continued to focus on his work and with a growing library of songs behind him, decided it was finally time to focus on putting together his album/portfolio to announce himself to the world. Last year proved a ground breaking year for Ryan. \u2018Overload\u2019, \u2018Until the time is right\u2019, \u2018Invisible\u2019 and \u2018Moving forward\u2019, tracks written with Zay \\u0026 D, received widespread critical acclaim.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a performing artist, his ambition is relentless. As a songwriter, his gift is unique and as a professional he continues to strive for perfection in an imperfect World\u2026\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 May 2012, Ryan released an E.P titled 'SE7EN'. Each track is centred around one of the seven deadly sins, using the sin itself as the concept for the song.

His background as an electronic music producer who first experimented with hip hop and jungle breaks has led him on a journey to his current, visionary experimental techno- industrial sound. His music is characterized by a modular, synth-heavy approach to sound design, combining heavy beats with thick, distorted synths riffs. He joined the dark forces of \u201cNoise\u201d in 2010 in London, where, surrounded by crazy musicians and toy circuit benders, he found himself in an underground scene that helped him to explore and develop a passion for analogue equipment. As a performer he believes in the power of live analogue performances. This allows him to shape the sound for the dancer, generating unexpected switches from acidic techno industrial to trip breaks and distorted drums.\\nAs well as his solo work, he is also founder of COBRACANI, a dynamic collaboration with Italian producer Alberto Brunello (HEXN).The duo have come together to create some truly unique sounds, blending different styles into an experimental rhythmic noise of alien anarchic analogue live performance.\\n\\n\\nemail CONTACT:\\ndariov.grazian@gmail.com",

        "description": "For bookings, remixes, additional download links and any other enquiries, email: csy.music@gmail.com\\r\\n\\r\\nCSY is a London based DJ and Producer. Growing up on Hip Hop, CSY discovered the freedom and endless possibilities that go hand in hand with Dance music when he began making music himself, so he delved deep into elements of electro, deep house and techno whilst still having a hold on his hip hop roots. Teaming up with Aaron Horn (Son of Trevor Horn) forming the foundations for CSY at Sarm Studios in West London. Horn was so impressed by CSY\u2019s creative flair, innovative style and eye for detail he signed CSY to Horn\u2019s Publishing label Dog Bot. However he was still somewhat of an unknown quantity to the public so he started making his own quirky bootlegs to raise his profile. These early productions stormed the blogs and his mixtapes for Dance on Glass spread like wildfire through the blogosphere. People were enchanted with his relentless tempo, bouncy, fizzing tone and seamless mixing. The \u2018CSY\u2019 name seemed to be a whisper in the ears of the industry and it was time to kick it up a notch. His addictive, infectious remix of The Bucketheads anthem The Bomb was the catalyst, and blogs, DJs and Media had a feeding frenzy on the CSY sound. However this was just the beginning as he still had an ace up his sleeve, and multiple edits, he dropped the CSY remix of Diplo\u2019s 2008 behemouth Must Be A Devil on the world. Who could have predicted the effects this track had on his peers. Its slick production, jackin melodies and a drop that reduced stomaches to jelly, made this a recipe for an unanswerable aural weapon. The reaction to this track was immediate and explosive. Mad Decent have now signed the remix due to Diplo dropping it in his sets during his US tour. Loose Cannons popped it on during their Kiss FM show, Kissy Sell Out played it on Radio 1 and it has been a frequent flyer on air from Detroit to Berlin. His own productions have been doing the rounds at the WMC in Miami this year and have been making asses shake and feet wiggle till the early hours.CSY is most definitely enjoying the fruits of his labours and this seems to be a dawn of a new age for the silky smooth songsmith. Watch this space\u2026..\\r\\n\\r\\nCSY has also taken some time out to work on some deeper material...\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck it out here:\\r\\nhttp://soundcloud.com/finncasey\\r\\nhttp://soundcloud.com/chromegnome",

Growing up I had a lot of different influences around me. Hip-Hop was my first love back in the early 90's and around 1991/2 my older brother introduced me to the Acid House sound, I never looked back! I've always been into my breaks. And Hardcore, Jungle/Drum \\u0026 Bass was what it was all about for me. As well as that and the Hip-Hop I'm feeling the halftime/140 vibes. I love the deeper/dark side of bass, music with an edge! I've played out locally on a regular basis over the last 20 years as part of the Platinum:beats and Sik Mix crews and since 2015 I've been pushing the radio vibes. A monthly resident on www.onlyoldskool.com was followed by a weekly show on LazerFM. I left the latter after a year, before joining the After Dark radio crew.",

In the same way I hope to be able to truthfully say 'to live is Christ' (by God's mercy), I hope that to write, rap and record 'is Christ' also. \\n\\nSo this is my voice. What you hear in my music is the very thing I wish for the entire world to hear. It is the message of my existence because Jesus is the Way I go, the Truth I know and finally, with hope, the Life I live. So my aim is that this music is more than sound-waves in your ear, I hope it helps to paint a picture of Hope and Truth which can only be done through taking the focus from 'sex, drugs, money and the pleasures of the world' and fixing it on 'God, His Word, the Riches of a Relationship with Him and our Treasures in Heaven'. \\n\\nSo if you're looking for darkness, you're in the wrong place.\\n\\nPlease check out my website for my story, lyric videos and more: www.aceofficial.co.uk",

        "description": "Dj \\u0026 Producer JazzCool has been addicted to House Music since the early 90\u2019s. There\u2019s no limits or boundaries when it comes to JazzCool\u2019s musical style. He has the ability to read and perform to an audience and the end result is a musical journey.\\n\\nJazzCool has entertained and brought musical pleasure to many in London\u2019s bars and clubs over the years, including the infamous celebrity haunt \u2018Tramp\u2019 in London, as resident DJ for 2 consecutive years. JazzCool has also played at many other established venues prominent in the House Scene in UK and internationally.  JazzCool has also held regular shows on a number of UK radio stations over the years and gained a large following of dedicated listeners. \\n \\t\\nJazzCool\u2019s inspiration to mix started at 15 years old, when the Hip Hop scene was at its greatest. He began studying techniques performed by the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff, DJ Cash Money \\u0026 Eric B. His motivation to become a DJ was confirmed after he attended \u2018The annual Technics DJ Mixing Championship\u2019 which in turn inspired JazzCool enormously. This led to JazzCool mastering the art of scratching and playing 2 copies of the same record simultaneously to create different effects. As his DJ skills increased, he started playing House and Techno music \\u0026 that is when the journey of becoming a recognized DJ began.\\n \\nAs the underground House Music scene in the UK became more prevalent, JazzCool applied the same techniques and formula he had learned previously. His love of House music resulted in JazzCool gradually building an extensive collection of Vinyl containing most genres of House music produced over the years. \\n \\nBut JazzCool\u2019s multi-faceted talent doesn\u2019t just end at delivering musical pleasure to the House music audience on the dance floor; JazzCool\u2019s music production allows him to express his musical creativity to the maximum and take his skills to the next level.  JazzCool\u2019s love of producing Afro House Music has lead to him recently release his first debut track \u2018From the Land of Kush\u2019 (In Deep Mix) on the album \u2018Written in Stone\u2019 on Dave Anthony\u2019s label \u2018Kemet Soul Records\u2019",

Been around music/dancing from at a very early age, it wasn't Hip Hop but it helped me a lot when it came to working with music in general. I have been rapping and making beats since 2008, but got more serious in 2011. There have been few people around me who influenced my way of thinking and the general look at the world. Let's just say they showed me the way and helped me find out who I was and who I wanted to be.\\n\\nArtists such as C-Bo, D-Block, Brotha Lynch Hung, Tech N9ne, 2Pac, Biggy, Killa Tay, Wu-Tang, KRS One, Common, Big Pun, Tray Dee, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Goldie Loc, Tha Dogg Pound, Nas and other similar artists have influenced my flow, my beats and my lyrics. I feel very proud for the fact that these people have been my influence in the game, because as most of yall know these are the legends in the game. Just sharing my opinion here, what is out there today, is 99% fake and pointless. \\n\\nI'm working with Cubase for the mastering and Fruity Loops for the producing. Some of you might say that FL is for beginners and I agree with you, it is much easier to use than most of the others. Don't get me wrong, you can still make some really nice beats on it, if you have it, you have it, meaning that you'd be able to make a beat with a stick and a plastic bucket, right!

His ability to expertly select and fuse a wide array of music genres together, along with his charm, passion and focus are impossible to ignore.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his early teenage years, he gained a classic hip-hop education by spending hours in his bedroom immersed in stacks of vinyl.  This dedication landed him some of the gigs he is most proud of today which include being the supporting act for Pitbull at his concert at the Indigo O2 as well as warming up for house music extraordinaire Joachim Garraud at OneForOne Park Lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsad began his career as resident DJ at renowned London nightclubs Pangaea and Taman Gang where he was quickly recognized for his eclectic style, and the ability to read a crowd.  This recognition opened doors to opportunities to play in numerous highly reputable venues including Public, The Box, The Cuckoo Club and Boujis.  Residencies in these clubs immediately followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsad now frequently travels the globe, recently playing in Dubai, Sweden, Switzerland, and France. The summer of 2012 has seen his international demand rocket, with regular bookings in New York, Marbella and Val d\u2019Isere.   \\r\\n",

        "description": "Leke Aerosoul - Founder / Designer / DJ @ www.aerosoul.co.uk \\r\\n\\r\\nBritish streetwear brand Aerosoul has been bridging the worlds of fashion and music for well over a decade. Initially conceived back in\\r\\n1998, founder Leke Adesoye (who trained at the London College of Fashion) drew inspiration from the thriving  jungle,hip-hop, soul and breakbeat scenes in his home city of London to create a brand that has remained synonymous with urban music and its vibrant sub cultures ever since.  As a drum \\u0026 bass and hip-hop DJ  fanatic, Leke sought to intertwine his passions for music and fashion by capturing the energy of the music. And  then designing original and desirable urban clothing - such as the now-iconic \u2018Junglist Movement\u2019 t-shirt. Out of humble beginnings, Aerosoul has since blossomed from a UK club-scene favourite into an internationally recognised brand, worn with pride by the very biggest names in urban music and beyond, From the very start, Leke has had little trouble recruiting both genuine legends and fast-rising stars from the realms of  the underground and urban music scenes to represent the Aerosoul brand. Among those who\u2019have modelled and  been seen with an Aerosoul design emblazoned across their chests are the likes of D-Double-E, Roots Manuva, Natty, Bryan G, MistaJam, Ricky Haywood-williams, Omar, MJ Cole, A Guy Called Gerald, Paradox, DJ Die, Skinnyman, A.I,  Normski, Ian Wright , Zion I, Robert Owens, TY,  Leon Best,  General Levy, Mutt, Domu, Lynx \\u0026 Kemo, Doc Brown , Dot Rotten , Ed Sheeran and Rodney P. Plus many more. Aerosoul is perhaps most famous for the near-ubiquitous \u2018Junglist Movement\u2019 design, as featured in the film Human Traffic  back in 1999 and still going strong today. ",

They draw influence from a wide range of artists and genres across the musical spectrum, from Classic Rock/Metal to EDM, from Funk to Grunge, Blues to Hip Hop and everything in between, held together by a solid love of songwriting and a burning passion to perform. ISOS have been compared to the likes of early Faith No More/ Pantera/Incubus amongst many others.\\n\\nSince the bands inception, the boys have been creating a vicious racket on the live front having already shared stages with the likes of Knuckledust, Mortad, Painted Smiles, US Metallers IKILLYA, Skreamer, Second Rate Angels, Stormbringer, Sacred Mother Tongue, Cypher 16, Cambion, The More I See (who handpicked them to open up at an Earache Records/Metropolis Music \\nShowcase in London) and ended last year as support to Absolva and Bloodstock favourites Evil Scarecrow. Following a high octane set at Hammerfest 2013 in North Wales, ISOS have played at sold out shows at The Borderline and Relentless Garage in London, and blown audiences away all over the country, blending a fine mix of infectious melodies, raw emotion and an intense interaction with their crowd all recurring themes throughout their promising young live career. A 5 track EP, released in October 2012 entitled \u2018A Breakdown of Character\u2019 (released via itunes/Amazon) saw the single \u201cUproar\u201d get playlisted on Scuzz TV\u2019s Nonstop Metal Playlist.\\n\\nIn Search Of Sun are due to release their debut album out on August 4th via Plastichead Distribution. With national shows and tours pouring in, there will be ample opportunity to taste the fire that this 10 track beast of a record will have to offer. Production duties set to be handled by the talented Mr Phil Kinman (Deadly Circus Fire/Tank/Paul Di\u2019Anno) and mastered by Harry Hess (Cancer Bats). The World is Yours Single is out now via iTunes.  Expect a furious eargasm!\\n\\n\u201cHeavy, furious and fun. This is what music should be.\u201d ROOM THIRTEEN.\\n\\n\u201cAs a punter, I can vouch for their hugely energetic live performance and I recommend you go forth and \\nexperience it at the next opportunity. They truly are a credit to the UK live underground scene\u201d METALMOUTH.NET\\n\\n\u201cTo my jaded old ears, this is the best metal debut I\u2019ve heard in years.\u201d THISISNOTASCENE.COM",

Unfortunately this is not easy so expect to hear music ranging from Drum and Bass to Blues, Rock n Roll, Funk, Reggae, Disco, House, Breakbeat and Hip Hop, I am a crap networker so if you hear it and enjoy the music I make get in touch as I would love to do collaborations with other musicians and producers and vocalists.\\nI like to play music loud and therefore my music is designed to be played loud, I hope you enjoy.\\n",

        "description": "Music and audio obsessed Kit first became a fanatic of the UK dance music scene after tuning into the sounds of Jungle and Hip Hop during the early 1990's. A dose of Rock \\u0026 Roll and Blues music was chucked into the mix for good measure courtesy of his parents. \\n\\nQuickly snapping up a love for DJ'ing, Kit purchased a set of decks when he was 16 and started to spin House, Garage and Drum \\u0026 Bass at parties and festivals which were organised by a local youth club. It was here that he met more like minded people. Having gained this new found love in DJ'ing, Kit secured regular slots at London venues such as Plan B, The Egg, Turnmills, Hidden plus many more during his early years as an adult. Bookings in cities such as Bournemouth, Manchester and Southampton quickly followed. Production was a natural progression for Kit and the coming years saw him churn out a discography of originals and remixes which have since made their way into the Official Drum \\u0026 Bass Arena charts and onto BBC Radio playlists!\\n\\nNot one to aim his ambitions down just one avenue, Kit has used his knowledge from the past years to successfully set up Proximity Recordings with his friend Basher. Focusing the label on the more deeper and darker realms of Drum \\u0026 Bass, the pair have taken the imprint to new territories far and wide. With a healthy roster of artists, monthly parties around the UK \\u0026 all over Europe, plus a dedicated release schedule, Kit has now established himself as label manager at Proximity and is constantly busy making it all visually come together! He still continues to DJ regularly and to push himself to new limits in the studio so expect to hear more from this guy very soon!\\n\\nFor bookings please visit Worldclass Management \\n\\nhttp://www.wcmuk.org/\\nhttp://www.wcmuk.org/artists/kit\\n\\nGeneral Inquiries:\\ninfo@wcmuk.org\\n\\nBooking Inquiries:\\nbookings@wcmuk.org\\n\\nArtist Management Inquiries:\\nhelenk@wcmuk.org",

        "description": "producer/songwriter/vocalist\\n\\nFrancesca Lewis aka sansha is a 23 year old musician from the outskirts of London.\\nGrowing up in rural Buckinghamshire with a music teacher for a mother and drama teacher for a father, She  spent her childhood undertaking a rigorous classical training on the violin trumpet and voice, taking opera lessons from her grandmother and competing in local competitions.\\n\\nWhen she approached the age of 18 Francesca wanted a break from the confines of classical music and bought a jazz song book, teaching herself all the chords and songs, and this influence you can hear in her song-writing structures. She put on her first one-woman show entitled \u2018Jazz and friends\u2019 in her home-town including a programme entirely on jazz material with a jazz pianist.  On her gap year she got a residency playing the keyboard and singing in the background of a pub in Soho and it was around this time that she began to write her own material on the keyboard.  \\n\\nDuring her time at Southampton University where she studied music, Francesca wrote over 40 songs and taught herself the guitar. One Easter break she went on holiday where she had a rocky time with her family and as she had her laptop with her and had recently been spending time with electronic producers decided to have a go at producing some songs herself. It was then that she produced 9 songs in one month. The first of them written which was about the holiday; 'A Good Time,' got aired as track of the week on BBC introducing three counties radio. These self produced songs are heavily inspired by the close harmonies of the 70s group the carpenters, 80s pop song style of Hall\\u0026Oates and rhythm of modern jazz ensembles. These songs she began to record at home where she picked up her violin again to add some string accompaniment. \\n\\nEarning money with residencies in some Southampton restaurants as a background live entertainer, Lewis bought herself a launch-pad  for her 21st birthday. She began to perform her electronic music live as well as the acoustic material around Southampton, performing at house parties, a Sofar Session, some small festivals, and landed a spot at her university's graduation boat ball, getting a name for her witty on-stage chat and engaging personality. \\nWhile doing a hip hop module as part of her music course and listening to a lot of the streets, she had also began adding rap and spoken word into her toolbox and released a song called 'the boy never left you behind' where she speaks over syncopated bass and drum beats about a strange incident that happened to her while living in her student house.\\nIn her last term of university Francesca wrote a song about her sad feelings of departure, to which she teamed up with producer Buddy Love to make a smooth dance track titled \u2018Stay in Contact\u2019 which features a trumpet solo from her. This got her back on the BBC three counties show where she did two interviews, then on BBC Radio One on the 8th of March when Huw Stephens aired it on his show.\\nSince leaving university Francesca drew on the post-graduation blues with her song 'daytime tv' where she sings, plays the piano, uses the launch-pad, raps and plays the trumpet. You can find a live session video she made of this track in 2016 on Youtube.\\n2017 saw Sansha perform two of her tracks electronically live on BBC three counties radio, a Sofar Sounds in Sweden, another sell out show in the Drawing Rooms Chesham, Butetown carnival Cardiff, as support on the Bournemouth Exeter and Plymouth parts of musician James Kirby's tour and frequent sets around London. She is currently working on a self-produced EP, incorporating some sounds she sampled while in The Gambia and gigging around London.",

Graduating with a first class BA honors degree from Leeds College of Music winning the coveted David Holt Saxophone Prize. Thomas' skills lie in his uncanny improvisational ability and unique creative compositional approach to the jazz and free improv idiom. With influences from the modern jazz world (Coltrane, Steve Coleman, Zorn etc.) along with keen interests in Contemporary Improvised music (Bailey, Evan Parker, ICP, AECM), Balkan folk music, Hindustani Classical music, Afro Cuban music and DIY Avant Guard Electronica Thomas' style has very broad yet totally original influences.\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\nThomas' main musical focus is involved with the acute and detailed processes of improvisation and how it can be squeezed, manipulated and synthesised with elements from separate genres and academic processes from the contemporary classical world to produce wonderfully elaborate music that inspires both the the mind and the spirit. One such example of this in Thomas\u2019 music is his use of Dutch composer Peter Schatt\u2019s Tone Clock; a twelve tone system that uses varying combinations of intervals to produce 12 unique modes or \u201chours\u201d . \\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\nAfter Graduation in 2012 from CODARTS Conservatory in Rotterdam as a Master of Music (funded by the Arts Council of Wales\u2019 Advanced study award program) Thomas has toured the UK and Europe extensively with many different projects the most notable being Leeds based critically acclaimed group Omnivore, Rotterdam (NL) Based Hip-Hop group The Refreshed Orchestra and the Cologne (DE) based free improv groups Blemishes and Damsels in Distress.\\n\u00a0\\n\u00a0\\nHaving performed with many artists, names including Claude Deppa, Tony Allen (Fela Kuti), Brian Jackson (Gil Scott-Heron), Mathew Bourne, Frank Vigroux, Chris Sharkey (Acoustic Lady Land, Trio Vd), Dave Kane, Huw Warren, along with being a previously active Member of LIMA (Leeds improvised Music Association. )Thomas is now based in London, UK and is currently writing for London based new music/improvising trio New World Order and Solo Project THL Solo.",

He played house and garage for two years before the station changed its idea's and decided not to broadcast anymore. At this point, and early in his career, Jay was left questioning his next move.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis growing passion for music and the music industry led him to producing and writing at the age of 20. He'd realised that playing other peoples music wasn't enough, he wanted to create his own music.\\r\\n\\r\\nJay embarked on, and completed, a sound recording and music technology diploma. With his new found skills and knowledge he felt ready to push forward with his own vision. Jay has always had the passion, but at various points life circumstances had blocked his progression. He had now reached a point where he was able to match the passion with the determination.\\r\\n\\r\\nFast forward to 2010, and Jay began building on his own studio, investing in new equipment that allowed for more control over the music he was producing. It enabled the vocalists he was working with to record with him in his studio, meaning Jay was now able too see his projects through from the initial instrumental to final recorded track.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last 12 months have seen massive growth and publicity for this versatile, talented producer. He has been working on various tracks with numerous artists and making valiant efforts to push his music forward to the mainstream. His ability to produce music from a variety of musical genres has made him a desirable producer for artists to work with. Most recently Jay has gone back to his roots as a DJ, playing out at events and re kindling his love for the house and garage scene. His main focus, however, is pushing forward with his producing and discovering new and up coming artists. To further improve his production skills and qualities, Jay has stepped outside the digital world and is now in the process of working on his use of live instruments, specifically the piano.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 2012 Jay Enna formed a collective consisting of himself, Benny Major and DJ Garmzie. They have collaborated under the moniker \\",

South London raised songstress' uses her femininity to empower stereotypes of women in urban music and takes an \u2018Eastern meets Western\u2019 stand on her music; an un-orthodox approach on honest relatable lyrics couples with Carnatic melisma with influences similar to SZA and Kehlani.

The London born producer and multi-instrumentalist, draws from her Ghanaian/Jamaican heritage and whilst the EP takes most of its influence from the soul music tradition, it also has touches of Afrobeat, Dancehall and House which blend seamlessly into the music. As a classically trained pianist, Natasha\u2019s is comfortable performing solo at the piano but her showcases also include an energetic combination of live musicians and pre-recorded sound. Previous tracks include Superman, a striped back piano-lead Hip Hop/Ballad and Stress Free which quickly grabbed the attention of electronic dance producers, resulting in several remixes from DJ\u2019s across Europe. Release dates to be announced shortly. \\n\\n#FlowersEP",

Working for them came from myself, Dj Tubby (Newham Generals/Dirty Stank) djing in a local wine bar in Alexandra Palace and all of us on the same vibe musically, from there our relationship developed due to our love of music and dubplates plus anything new!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom there I got breaks in many clubs such as Stratford Rex, Chimes, Club UN, Desire, Club Desire and dj\u2019ed on many radio stations holding down regular spots on Rude FM (1994), Future FM (1994- 1995) Mc Budd, Ruud Awakening (1995-1997) with MC Funsta \\u0026 Krazy-B and the now famous Rinse FM (1997- 2001) with the now even more famous MC Wiley / Eskiboy, Bruza, Triple Treat, Lethal \\u0026 Ill Matic R, and even passed my show onto long time friend and DJ.. Tubby.   He is signed to Dirty Stank with Newham Generals.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many years of success Smokers Inc decided to close label closed in 1999, and I decided to focus in other areas from 2001.  After keeping a close ear to the ground and going out to hear a new beats. I got into the dubstep, started producing 18 months ago with great results.  Tracks already featuring on Hindzy D\u2019s dubstep show Axe FM and on Newham Generals Rinse FM show.  Plus two tracks released on Hindzy D\u2019s Summer of Dub and Autumn Dubs.  Looking to start my own label now and have put a lot of work into making sure the tracks are big.\\r\\n\\r\\n",

        "description": "Born in the United Kingdom, with a degree (in both Acting and Psychology), Brass made his way to Universal Records where he launched his career, initially behind the scenes in the corporate side, then as a Hip Hop artist as well as a producer of Hip Hop. But Pop and Dance would not be far behind.\\n\\nAn alchemist of music, rapping and songwriting, his career as a producer/ lyricist lead straight to Bollywood and Oscar winner AR Rahman where his musical spirit could run free. It also steered him toward what would become a long-term collaboration with AR Rahman\u2019s team and Bollywood directors Shekhar Kapoor (Elizabeth) and Jagmohan Mundhra (Provoked) that began in 2005 and continues to this day.\\n\\nAs a gifted musician with a great heart (that comment comes straight from his students), Brass Tax has passed on his knowledge and experience to a multitude of young musicians both privately and through his workshops in Miami. As a progressive composer and arranger, Brass Tax\u2019s work has been recognised by the industry in many ways but is a Battle Rapper at heart, including taking First Prize in the Live audience Jump Off battle Rap Tournaments in Miami Florida. \\nBrass Tax\u2019s two forthcoming recordings are both surprising and Emotional. The first, Blunt Force Trauma - is the first in a series of Mixtapes, encompassing a wide array of vocal ability and emotions, but raw to the core. The second is the eagerly anticipated UK debut Hip Hop Album \u201cHeat Of The Moment\u201d-Universal, which is set to be released later in 2011.\\n\\nYou may have to stop and take a deep breath just from reading what Brass Tax has accomplished to date - but he won't! Brass\u2019 ideas, spark, talent and enthusiasm know no limits. He is the future and with that unmistakable voice and raw hip hop sound \u2013 often compared to Grammy Award Winner Timbaland, He's off and running again, bringing his abundant talents and tireless spirit to the next endeavour as 2016 is the year of Brass Tax!!",

        "description": "First off the name E-Own, people always wonder what the hell it means. Its short for Aeonian; physically a rock, metaphorically meaning permanence, enduring without change in condition, aka staying the same, aka keeping it real. I liked all of that so I took the name, gift wrapped it with some Hip-Hop flavour and ran with it. In my career it translates to making sure I never change no matter what and the tracks that I make are Aeonian, permanent, they\u2019ll be here after I leave so that inspires me to put in maximum effort every time.\\n\\n I\u2019ve had a passion for music from as far back as I can remember, there\u2019s definitely a family influence there as well. A lot of artists have a love affair with music but not too many have kids with it and that\u2019s what happened with my Father Junia Walker, a Reggae artist and producer from the 70\u2019s. The lower levels of the family tree are now all making music and loving it. That same family background brought classic musical material into the house, Vinyl, DJ Clue mix tapes and generally a lot of real Hip-Hop classics not yet re-mastered. \\n\\nI did a few talent shows in my kiddy days, most notably Finsbury Park Rainbow Theatre. I wrote a piece that I sang with a guy named Philip playing piano in the background. I was nervous as hell in front of a few hundred people but got a good reception and that was at about age nine if I remember right. That gave me the inspiration to want to make something happen with music.\\n\\nI heard there was a talent show coming up in school so I wrote a song and convinced two dudes to MC with me. I took two verses for myself and gave two away. I was listening to DJ Pied Piper and the masters of ceremony at the time and they had the hit track \u201cDo you really like it?\u201d So Solid Crew were also dominating the urban scene with \u201c21 seconds\u201d getting a lot of airplay. Being young and impressionable all that stuff influenced what I wrote and the rap had an old skool UK garage feel to it. We formed a rap group called the FJ\u2019s for the talent show, shout out to Francis and Jesse. We were11 at that time and came 2nd in the talent show, a S Club 7 tribute group won. A side note to anyone organizing a school talent show, teachers for judges does not work, put some youths on the panel. The plus side was that we got acclaim from all the students despite losing and popular consensus said we should have won so if the audience is happy I\u2019m happy. \\n At 12 I bought the first albums I could call my own. I got Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s survivor album from Virgin Megastores and it had a buy 1 get 1 free offer on it, looking around the store I found the 2pac \u201cAll eyez on me\u201d album also on a buy 1 get 1 free, can u believe that. I never knew much about him before that but pleaded with my mom to buy it with me giving her the money and I overcame the parental advisory sticker. I got home, put it in my stereo (thanx to Aunt Blossom and Angie for that one) turned down the volume and put my ear to the speaker, parental advisory vibes again, didn\u2019t wanna have swearing blaring, but that was then, this is now. Anyway before I get sidetracked, after hearing that album an obsession with 2pac began. All the lyrics were learnt and I do think at one point I knew the whole double off by heart and my lunch money slowly started turning into the 2pac discography. \\n\\nThe 2pac influence didn\u2019t immediately make me want to be a rapper; instead at about 13 I started writing poetry, a lot of it. At some point I was writing a poem a day then started posting them on AOL poetry boards for responses, I got a lot of positive feedback and encouragement which built up my belief that I had a talent for writing. I then after about a year stepped up to writing and posting on established poetry sites and the positive feedback continued. Around this time I started making trips to with my dad, trips to studios, record shops, concerts, basically getting to know every facet of the music industry, and I got to know and love the struggle, the highs and the lows. The way your pen hitting the paper eventually leads to people dancing and maybe changing someone\u2019s life when they hear something, there\u2019s no words to describe that.\\n\\nAt 17 I started seriously wanting a career in music for I think all the right reasons, nothing to do with money, fame, sex, I just want to make music people have love for and progress to be the best. I\u2019m not obsessed with wanting to be number one but best believe I\u2019m not working hard putting everything into music to be number two. The people around me then started making quality instrumentals which have given me a foot up into the game; shout out to Kapital, T-Boy, Hasan, Kevin and Devious who all helped to build a movement one track at a time; we all know dreams don\u2019t have deadlines.\\n\\n I later began to develop more as an independent artist performing at whatever live venues I could and began Collaborating with an East London artist called Afriking. My live performances sharpened up but I felt like I wasn't getting instrumentals of a decent quality quickly enough. Real life caught up with us to some extent. Some producers were unreliable, University kicked in, some stopped making music . Producers outside of my circle and network all seemed to be trying to get rich off one half decent beat, which inspired me to set up E-Own Studios. I went on a three level music production course with Artefacts Entertainment and got into the deeper levels of composition and sound engineering. The aim ever since has been to make life easier for UK recording artists especially with instrumentals available to suite any price range. I was drawn to music production not because I necessarily felt I wanted to be a Producer but because I felt I had to be a Producer.\\n\\n",

        "description": "CIRCLE OF FUNK\\r\\n\\r\\nCircle of Funk have their roots firmly in Bristol, the music capital of the UK\u2019s South West \u2013 all four members \u2013 Lee Robinson, Paul Stephenson, Andy Caulfield and Daniel Ankrah were born there.\\r\\n\\r\\nBristol has given rise to many music greats including Tricky, Portishead, Roni Size, Stanton Warriors, Smith and Mighty, and the legendary Wild Bunch who later became Massive Attack. \\r\\n\\r\\nLee and Paul met at College in Bristol and started out in the music business as \u201cThe Cutz\u201d, which soon became one of Bristol\u2019s most prestigious underground Hip Hop shows, and resulted in them being featured as guests on Radio One\u2019s Tim Westwood show. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998 they formed a DJ duo called Culture Shock, their apt name reflecting the extraordinary, envelope-pushing music that they played. They made a name for themselves in and around the bars and clubs of South London, especially around the Brixton area. These haunts included the popular venues of the Bug Bar and Loughborough Junction, and at the end of the evening they would hand out CDs to the regular clientele. The CD\u2019s were compilations of UK and US underground music including soulful house, rare groove and funk as well as exclusive promos from important record labels such as Swing City and Defected. The guys had also travelled to New York where they were given promos and music from some of the most prominent and cutting-edge DJs, and these mixes were also included on the CDs. The feedback was extremely positive and Culture Shock gained quite a following, however the name Culture Shock was in no way unique, and the boys needed a name that would make them instantly identifiable from the other DJs, producers and musicians on the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Lee\u2019s school buddy, Andy Caulfield joined them and \u201cCircle of Funk\u201d was born. Andy was already an established DJ and Producer from the days of The Cutz, and his combination of musical tastes, refreshing attitude, and talent complemented the group perfectly. The trio were buzzing off the vibe, and compiled more mixed CDs to hand out at gigs. They were in demand for nights such as City Loud and Pushca and were soon given an opportunity by Bristol house music veteran Deli G (The Touch) to play in their home town. The guys were great fans of Deli and he became both a guru and an inspiration for Circle of Funk, helping them out with advice when needed. Deli is still in touch with Circle of Funk and continues to mentor and assist them to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group\u2019s first international booking came in 2003 when they travelled to beautiful Croatia, full of excitement and not knowing what to expect. Croatia was new territory for UK DJs and a whole new experience for Circle of Funk. They spun at the capital of Zagreb, the coastal town of Zadar and a small village called Koprivnica, making many new friends on their travels, revelling in the vibe and soaking up the culture. Such was the impact of the initial visit, that the boys subsequently returned to Croatia a further three times, receiving a warm welcome each time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005 social media became a novel and good way of promoting themselves and Circle of Funk created a MySpace page to post their music. They received very good feedback globally, and it also allowed them to listen to a whole network of other musicians via the wonders of the internet, hence opening up a whole new window of opportunity for them. Circle of Funk felt that their music was improving enough to approach vocalists and they contacted Mandy Senior who was working with Basement Jaxx at the time. Mandy gave them the chance to remix her track \u201cGames\u201d, and this coincided with the boys\u2019 decision to create their own label \u2013 \u201cSlapped up Soul\u201d.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006 Slapped up Soul came to fruition with \u201cGames\u201d being the very first release. Circle of Funk distributed the single around as many of the London record shops as they could including the legendary vinyl joints: Uptown, Black Market, Know How records, Bar Vinyl and Vinyl Junkies. They soon realised that they couldn\u2019t distribute the record as widely as they needed to, and their close friend Derek told them about a distribution company called One Nation. One Nation loved the track and took all of the copies to sell (except for a few which the group kept as souvenirs). This was the first and only time that Circle of Funk produced vinyl. The digital age was dominating the music scene and many DJs were ditching their vinyl in favour of new technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nLee became a MySpace addict, enthusiastically connecting with other musicians and producers worldwide. He formed a strong friendship with a young producer from Bristol called Daniel Ankrah a.k.a. Blackjack and introduced Blackjack\u2019s music to the other members of the group. The boys met up with Daniel to work on a project initially, but everybody soon agreed that Daniel should become the fourth member of Circle of Funk, and so the trio became a quartet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 Lee and Paul travelled to their first Winter Music Conference in Miami and networked with some of the DJs, producers and artists that had inspired them from afar. They used the opportunity to promote \u201cGames\u201d further, giving the vinyl to the people who they had been unable to reach before. It was in Miami that they met Tank Martinez who touched them with his words of wisdom, telling them to believe in themselves and giving them some new-found confidence. Sadly Tank Martinez has since passed away, but he lives on in Circle of Funk\u2019s consciousness and a future release will be dedicated to his memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey returned to the UK motivated and inspired, and it wasn\u2019t long before the next release was completed \u2013 The Janet Walsh EP which featured the tracks \u201cIn the City\u201d and \u201cM4 Movements\u201d. This time the release was promoted digitally to various DJs and producers around the world, and the boys were delighted to receive their first positive feedback from the New York Legend DJ/Producer Jon Cutler.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009 Circle of Funk were invited to play at the Winter Music Conference in Miami while promoting their fourth release on Slapped Up Soul - \u201cControl Room\u201d. It was very well received both in the US and the UK, and helped to enhance the label\u2019s reputation further. The track grabbed the attention of Phil Asher, head of the Restless Soul label and production team, and a turning point came when Phil placed \u201cM4 Movements\u201d at the top of his \u201cTen \u2018outta ten\u201d UK chart in the February 2009 edition of DMC magazine.\\r\\n\\r\\nProducing music is more than a hobby for the Circle of Funk boys \u2013 it is both a passion and a way of life, their unique talents being a gift from God. They are a group that like to surprise their audience by pushing the boundaries of dance music, and their diverse cultural heritage (the group have ancestors from Jamaica, West Africa, and Ghana as well as the UK) is reflected in the depth and richness of their deep soulful house grooves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir musical influences originated in the 80\u2019s soul music scene with performers such as Michael Jackson, Chaka Khan, Adeva, Loose Ends and Kym Sims. Their inspiration grew with 90\u2019s Old School hip hop where they became more immersed in the music around them and started to follow legendary producers including DJ Premier from Gang Starr, Pete Rock and CL Smooth, Kenny Dope, J Dilla, MF Doom, Mobb Deep, Heltah Skeltah, A Tribe Called Quest, Notorious BIG, EPMD, and Public Enemy. In fact the first LP that Lee bought was \u201cIt Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back\u201d by Public Enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul became heavily involved in the competitive DMC Turntablist scene in the mid 90\u2019s and he started to follow celebrated DJs including Stevie Dee, Rob Swift, Mista Sinista, DJ Qbert and the late Roc Raida.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boys enthusiastically absorbed as much knowledge as they could from their older peers such as Grant and Delge from Massive Attack, Tricky, Roni Size, Stanton Warriors, Deli G, Mike Shaw, DJ Lynx, and other extended family members, friends, and associates from Bristol\u2019s vibrant musical landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircle of Funk continue to cement their reputation in the production world and are currently receiving great feedback from the likes of David Harness, Andy Ward, DJ Spinna, Mr V, Danny Krivit, Josh Milan, Phil Asher, Jon Cutler, Boddhi Satva, Abicah Soul, Vinny Da Vinci, CJ Mackintosh, Grant Nelson, Hippie Torales, Booker T, Graeme Park, Tyrone Francis, Bugz in the Attic, Simbad and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boys have been invited to remix tracks by many artists including Louise Golbey, Rightside ft Ronnie Canada, Alliance DC ft Rachael Calladine, and MrBougx from South Africa which is due for release towards the end of 2013 and already receiving 'rave' reviews.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have also been delighted to feature remixes from \u201cFlex\u201d aka Paul Francombe who has known Dan from their schooldays. Flex\u2019s remixes have featured on Circle of Funk\u2019s releases of \u201cIn Love\u201d and most recently \u201cInvisible\u201d ft Robert Owens.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Owens is a well-established artist, having featured on many great house tracks including Frankie Knuckles and Satoshi Tomiie\u2019s classic hit \u201cTears\u201d. The boys regard it a great honour and pleasure to have collaborated with such an inspiring and talented artist, and Robert has played a major role in reinforcing their belief in what they do. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey are also working with top male and female vocalists such as close friend Lifford Shillingford (who featured on Artful Dodger\u2019s \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Turn Me On\u201d and Circle Of Funks very own \u201cFeelin It\u201d), Natasha Watts \u2013 Purple Music (and also Soul Survivors Best New Artist 2013), Dawn Tallman, Frances Mary and Charlene Samms.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircle of Funk promise some exciting future releases including a collaboration with one of their idols \u2013 Mr V, as well as working with a variety of artists to produce different genres of music including Nu Soul, Downtempo and Electronica. There is always an element of surprise in their work which they hope will keep their music edgy and intriguing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey recently teamed up with soulful house producers Wipe the Needle (Lee Gomez and Mikael Nybom). We can expect some dynamite project collaborations and remixes from this heavyweight force who will be not only producing deep house music, but also groundbreaking downtempo, nu soul sounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fans can look forward to several international gigs planned with live singers, a label launch party for Slapped Up Soul and its artists, more free exclusive downloads of back-catalogue works and mixes, Circle of Funk merchandise, a brand new interactive website and a new radio show, all coming very soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook out for much more to come, and a bright and bold future as Circle of Funk continue to move forward, bringing innovation, vibrancy and ingenuity to the dance music arena.",

He began playing guitar at age 13 in 1996 and studied music technology at Keele University in 2001 to 2005 (along with philosophy). It was here that his tastes for electronic textures developed as he gradually abandoned conventional rock instrumentation and composition for far more abstract (and lengthy) pieces that straddled the sonic spectrum between ambient, hip hop, so-called IDM and post rock.\\r\\nAfter graduating in 2005, he briefly re-settled in his home town of Oxford before moving to London in 2006 where he now resides, playing guitar for burgeoning indie/post-punk band the Comet Line (formerly Lightning Strikes the Empire State). At the moment, he is working hard at producing the band's debut album due for release in late 2012 but still hopes to produce a debut Reconnaissance release after that.",

OK, that was easy, but it had to be more to it than that. Very soon I've started to collect playlists and ended up with hundreds of gigabytes of club music. \\n\\nLater in college, where I've studied and earned a BA in finance, I always kept my ear towards both the local and international clubbing scenes. Parallel to that, heeding a relentless impulse of creative curiosity, I've explored the craft of acting in various workshops. Pretty soon I was only to discover the interconnections of the arts as they fuel each other through senses and ideas.\\n\\nNever letting go of music as my favorite medium to express emotions and experiences, I've set out to deepen my musical knowledge in London. The city's fervent clubbing scene has proven to be a most fertile land for educative collaboration and experimentation.  \\n\\nIn the last two years I've been committed to develop production skills. As the new information settled in my musical brain, it started to influence my creative output. New songs emerged from my experiences and luckily enjoyed a surprisingly positive feedback.\\n\\nRight now my ambition sets me on a journey to discover complex musical ideas vibrating with story and emotion.",

He used to listen to Radio Nova (Rap radio station), who were famous for their long DJ sets without talking. It was here that Patrick learnt about the intricacies of building a set and how different music could be woven together to create a certain feeling and to take the listener on a musical journey. \\n\\nIn the early 90's the electronic music scene appeared and started to spread through radio stations in France. Patrick started to follow this extraordinary movement with unshakeable intrigue. If he could, Patrick would love to go back in time and be a pivotal part of the Palace Club, famous for being one of the first venue in Paris where people (politicians, models, celebrities, punk rockers, music artists, homosexuals), were often found mixing together, rocking the dance-floor no matter what their background, skin color, or wallet value.\\n\\nHis DJ story began when he moved to London around 2004. He fell in love with this energetic city and its cosmopolitan mix of peoples and music genres. He bought his  1st Technics turntables a mixer and a few records. At that point he knew that his life was going to change, and felt that he had truly found his calling. \\n\\n2015 will see the launch of his 1st few EP's. Make sure to hear more of this talented dj and young producer.",

Looking back, that record changed my whole musical path to this day. You could say it was a deep inspiration!\\n\\nIt wasn't until 97/98, that I started buying records myself, having before that been content to listen to the tape packs from garage raves that were common back then. This despite the fact that I didn't own any decks to play them on! Fortunately, my close friend, owned a pair of belt driven Soundlab's.\\n\\nI was just crazy about the music, it had such an infectious feeling on me, the buzz from the amazing tunes being produced and that feeling of going down to the record shop in London's West End.\\n\\nMy love of House, in particular, the classic deep and soulful garage sound, has remained and is stronger than ever. In my mixes you'll hear deep and soulful house, garage and nu disco, always with an ode to that classic 90's sound.\\n\\n",

Energetic, feisty and a little bit bonkers, Mat really is the definitive \u2018one off\u2019 in a music world increasingly populated by copy-cat opportunists and serial re-hash- ers. Mat started out fronting Mower, a three-piece indie pop band, who was spotted by Blur\u2019s, Graham Coxon. After releasing a couple of albums on Coxon\u2019s, Transcopic Label, and tours with Scissor Sisters, British Sea Power and the Futureheads, Mower eventually called it a day. Mat\u2019s intense new sound is the result of being locked away for a couple of years, in the Worcestershire marshes, with only his old funk and hip hop LP\u2019s for company. Having pissed off everyone who ever cared for him, he found that he had no choice but to resort to using enemies in his band 'The People who hate him'.\\n\\nMat is now wreaking havoc in venues across the land, and has just finished recording his debut solo LP with Oli Dreamtrak. Tracks including Tunnel Vision, Acid Tongue and Crack Pot, along with a much-lauded cover of Talking Heads\u2019 Psycho Killer, champion a musical force that tinkers with influences including Parliament Funkadelic, The Rapture, Captain Beefheart, A Tribe Called Quest, Gang of Four, The Chemical Brothers and much much more.",

Some of his tracks appeared on playlists of such DJs as Marco Carola or Richie Hawtin. Every project he approaches, every track he finishes, every sound he generates has a deeper meaning and is part of a greater agenda. He says: \u201cMusic itself is boring. The real trick to music production is to tell a story\u201d and that is exactly what he does. Recently HUBA can be found in East London playing at parties like POINT, STUMP and many more.\\n\\n\\nBIO~\\nHubert HUBA Flow - DJ/Producer/Writer. Born and raised in Wroclaw, Poland. His journey with music begins in late 90\u2019s when he starts writing his first lyrics and making Hip Hop beats. He releases 5 underground albums and plays loads of concerts. His music is known as original and sophisticated. After 9 years he realizes that Rap music is not enough.\\nDriven by the need of telling stories that can\u2019t be told in ordinary way he takes his first step towards Electronic Music. Music of fewer words and more atmospheric sounds fits perfect to his idea of expressing his new way of thinking. Fascinated by cosmos, quantum physics, human nature and Planet Earth Hubert starts working on his own, original sound.\\nHis favorite deep sounds are often seasoned with progressive feeling which makes his tech stuff very original and always full of surprises.\\nHubert Flow produces and mixes mainly minimal-techno. His tracks are always full of emotions and filled with deeper meaning. He always aims for more demanding floor and avoids easy solutions.\\nHUBA is strictly minimal-house oriented project. The deeper it sounds the more HUBA it is. It's full of raw samples and strong synthesizers, often finished with deep lyrics. Deep-Tech and groovy is the place where HUBA feels at home. Recently HUBA can be found in East London playing at afterparties like POINT and many more.\\n\\nOffstage he writes for film, video games and books.\\n\\nLabels: Deep Tech / Krad / Jelly Beast / minm.all / Samani / Berberis / Citrica / Alboratory / Tools And Stuff / P.U.N.C.H.I.S. / Baikonur Digital",

He first heard Hiphop, at the age of 8 when he was playing monopoly with family. The Fugees, was playing in the background. \u2018Ready or not was playing and I was amazed by the beats and lyrics \u2018. For an 8 year child, hiphop was interesting but it was later on his life that he decided to starting \u2018\u2019rapping\u2019\u2019. \\n\\nIt was when a certain white hip-hop artist, called Eminem appeared on MTV with his hit \u2018 Way I Am \u2018, that this young teenager wanted to rap. At first, he was writing raw angry lyrics like the ones Eminem rapped. Then he got into So Solid Crew, DJ Luck Mc Neat and various other garage legends.  After this he started emceeing to Garage. This was when he was 12 years old. It was a few years later, that he would record his first song. This was called \u2018 I\u2019m amazing \u2018, after playing a video game he gave himself the rap alter ego of Mazin. He had the lucky opportunity to record this song through a government funded youth initiative. He kept his head down and got a Business qualification. During break times, he would battle rappers and rap in cyphers. At that period, a new music genre was getting popular in his district called Grime. Grime was a mixture of jungle, drum \\u0026 bass, hiphop and garage. With 140 BPM, so he started emceeing to Grime and was forming crowds of supporters. \\n\\nHe decided to cut a single, at a youth club. Innocent produced it for him for about $25. This would go onto become his first \u2018\u2019hit\u2019\u2019 . Under his new artist name Glitz, he recorded \u2018 Glitz In Tha Bitz\u2019 . As soon as it was recorded he burnt loads of copies and distributed it in his local area. The track was popular and many people had it as their ringtone. Being young and na\u00efve he didn\u2019t understand the music industry so he didn\u2019t pursue a record deal with the single. \\n\\n. The friend wanted his help to run the event and also to find music acts to perform live. This gave him a zest for music again after being quiet for a while. So the old friend said, he should start going to open mics and perform. This lead to nearly a year and half of attending the open mic circuit. He had made a friendship with a hiphop DJ, who he attended open mics with. After a creative difference argument, he stopped being friends with the DJ. Although their friendship was over, they have achieved a lot. Glitz changed to Franklin Freshman, since he felt it was time to grow up from a childish tag name. They were runners up, in the July 2012 \u2018 In it To Win it \u2018 music contest and the hiphop dj, helped pushed him musically to what you see today. \\n\\nThe projects Franklin Freshman has released, are A Slice of Cake, Candy and Sunshine and The Free Soundcloud EP. The most recent, is his debut album, Seeking The Knighthood. He has released two singles from this album, the first being \u2018Love Lost\u2019 which achieved almost 5000 views on Youtube and the second Garage single \u2018 Happy Days\u2019. \\n\\nFranklin Freshman, is back In the studio working on new material.\\nFranklin Freshman, is a young talent with much potential. He abuses the English language to the extent he is poetic and lyrical. With intentions of blending new school and old school sounds together, he feels that he will create music that generations will listen to for a long time. He has various influenced from Bob Marley, Kayne West, Kano to R.E.M and Blink 182.",

        "description": "Former Resident DJ\\nFamily \\u0026 The Biscuit Factory\\n\\nAt a very young age, Nathan Rowe wandered weary eyed into the kitchen of his parents home. Still running on mischievous youthfulness, he put a fully operational radio into the blender and continued to not give a fuck. As chunks of audio from crew like Underworld, The Prodigy \\u0026 The Chemical Brothers flew about the room, Nathan got his very first taste of mixing music. Then and there his love for blending songs was spawned, albeit in the most unconventional fashion possible. His parents couldn't care less about the mess he'd made, and ever since then he's crept out the bedroom window at night to run around the valley and spread his eclectic taste of modern sound. Since then people of the day may call him Nathan, but when darkness falls he's Nado.\\n\\nHaving drifted in and out of musical love all his life, a large portion of Nado's teen years were spent in a relationship with punk. Bands like NOFX, Blink 182, Reel Big Fish and Less Than Jake made up daily listening during this time, but hip hop and rap originals like Dr. Dre and Snoop kept shit honest. After turning 18, a transitional period made Nado realise there was more to dance music than the tacky stuff that plagued the radio. Once the revelation had fully swept over the now ambitious youngster, the decision to become a DJ was as clear as the Vodka on the rocks he was drinking.\\n\\nSince honing in on his purpose in life, Nado has shared the booth with international royalty like Porter Robinson, Zeds Dead, Borgore, Jack Beats, Wiwek, Valentino Khan, Caspa, Zomboy, Yellow Claw, Snails, UZ, Dodge \\u0026 Fuski, Doctor P, AutoErotique, Habstrakt, NGHTMRE, Getter, MUST DIE!, Delta Heavy, The M Machine, Pegboard Nerds, Ookay, ETC!ETC!, Barely Alive, Torro Torro, Victor Niglio, Sigma, Antiserum, Mayhem, Apashe, Boombox Cartel, Tropkillaz, Bear Grillz, Gent \\u0026 Jawns, Brillz, Dirtyphonics, Sikdope, Herobust, Twine, Crizzly \\u0026 many more, but also national treasures Will Sparks, Timmy Trumpet, Uberjak\u2019d, Joel Fletcher, SCNDL, J-Trick, Kronic, Krunk, New World Sound, Mashd N Kutcher, Tonite Only, The Potbelleez, Chardy, Ember, Bass Kleph, DCUP, Shockone, Alison Wonderland, Spenda C, Nick Thayer, Hydraulix, Oski, PhaseOne, Trumpdisco, A-Tonez, Seek N Destroy, COMMAND Q, HWLS, Rave Radio, Slice N Dice, Surecut Kids, Matt Watkins, Rob Pix, Danny T, Tenzin, Phetsta, Doctor Werewolf, KOMES, Bombs Away \\u0026 many more. He's sweated out sets in joints like Family, The Biscuit Factory, The Met, Oh Hello, GPO, TBC, Birdees, Arena, Normanby Hotel, Boundary Hotel, Fox Hotel, Chalk Hotel, Jubilee Hotel, the Velvet Underground in Cairns, Candys Apartment in Sydney, Alive on the Gold Coast, Fitzy\u2019s in Toowoomba, Ambassador Hotel in Mackay and even waved back at punters from stages at Stereosonic, Summafieldayze, Valley Fiesta and most recently the Futuredome at Future Music Festival. Alas, he remains humble, understanding that his talent is his foundation and that only hard work will push him to where he wants to be.\\n\\nNado's rise to prominence has meaning. He understands his goals and how he'll reach them. He understands just how many other DJ's there are in the world and what it will take to stand out from the crowd. He understands that he's chosen the right path and while his liver might hate him for it, he's one of the few people on this planet truly doing what he loves. I guess throwing that radio in the blender all those years ago wasn't such a bad thing after all.\\n\\nCourtesy of Your Friends House\\nwww.yourfriendshouse.com/",

Growing up in Birmingham on a healthy diet of 90\u2019s Hip Hop, POP, Breaks, R\\u0026B, Jungle, House \\u0026 Garage, Danny developed an eclectic taste for music.  With early influences ranging from Wu Tang Clan \\u0026 ONYX to DJ Spoony and the Dream Team, Danny felt blessed to be part of a great age of music and even more privileged to be there at the birth of House and Garage as we know it.  \\n\\nWith the rapid emergence of H\\u0026G in London, Birmingham was playing \u2018catch up\u2019, with bars and clubs still heavily focussed towards more mainstream Dance music.  Danny saw this as an opportunity and with a group of friends formed the group \u2018The Graveyard Shift\u2019, a group of talented DJ\u2019s and MC\u2019s determined to spread their infectious sound. \\n\\nAfter playing numerous private parties Danny got his break in 2000 playing a 2 hr H\\u0026G set at the iconic Custard Factory for a Millennium party.  This was the springboard that would take him into a world of music and entertainment.  He then went on to play a further 4 nights at the equally iconic Institute developing his unique bouncy, bumping sound further.\\n\\nIn early 2000 he knew that in order to take his DJ career to the next level, he had to move to the DJ heartland, London.  Pursuing his dream was difficult in London as any Londoner knows, and there was a period where \u2018life\u2019 had to take priority.  But Danny still managed to slowly build his profile, playing pubs, bars and small nightclubs.  \\n\\nIn 2005 Danny began working with a collective of Rappers/MC\u2019s just emerging onto the London scene called the \u2018WolfPack\u2019 and was privileged to soon be considered their exclusive DJ.  It was at this point he began to see that his skills also extended to production.  With a solid IT background and a love of music, he soon also became 1 of the 2 exclusive producers on all WolfPack material.  Managing to bridge a gap between House, Hip Hop \\u0026 R\\u0026B, WolfPack truly could entertain the masses and did so with some amazing partnerships with promoters of clubs such as Planet Hollywood, Funky Budha, Sound, Mayfair \\u0026 Sugar Hut.\\n\\nFast forward to 2012, Danny has now broadened his music offering combining elements of Electro \\u0026 Vocal/Commercial House with refreshing Hip Hop and R\\u0026B nuances to create his unique sound that gets crowds rocking.  Now taking influences and inspiration form talented Artists and DJ\u2019s like Annie Mac, Swedish House Mafia, Wideboys \\u0026 Calvin Harris.  Danny is really moving his career forward now with a residency at the plush Euphoriom Nightclub in Acton as well as DJ\u2019ing is also hosting many parties in and around top London venues.  His most recent gigs include Garage, Thomas A Becket, Russian Bar, Match Bar \\u0026 Arch 635 with many more bookings scheduled to finish off a very active year.  \\n",

Born and raised in London, United Kingdom, 10 minutes away from where the Hip-Hop legend Slick Rick was raised, Creamo had the Caribbean love for music, and rhythm passed down to him via his Jamaican parents.\\r\\nCreamo has been influenced by the likes of The Beastie Boys, Big Daddy Kane, Redman, London Posse, and Nas. When asked to describe his music, he says simply its Freezin, while his peers may describe it as hard hitting street music, presented with humour and skilled lyricism that informs as well as entertains. Tricksta CEO of Wolftown Recordings, describes Creamo as a real talent on the mic, with dutty bashy lyrics.\\r\\nHis achievements for an artist who has not yet had a album released are quite astonishing. He has already experienced performing at Wembley arena in front of 12,000 people along side Singer Wayne Marshall Performing the Remix to his hit single G- Spot. No stranger to the stage, Creamo has performed as a support act for artist such as Redman, Jodeci, Keith Murray, Joe, Brand Nubian, and Father as a member of his former group Kaycee, and DMX with fellow UK rapper Fredi Kruga.\\r\\nCreamo believes he can make an impact on the music world through delivering music that can be respected by purist, and appreciated by the masses Following Creamo's \\",

My beats have featured on some classic underground mixtapes, dvds etc but it all came to an end due to some unfortunate circumstances. I only managed to recover the ones which i've uploaded on the playlist. Majority of those beats are old and i didn't really get the chance to finish them or find my newer instrumentals but check them out as they're still banging and available for free.\\n\\nI've been away for too long but i'm back ready to bring some new heat that i will be uploading on here from now on so be on a look out. I'd say my beats have a raw/gritty/versatile/soulful kinda sound to it so if u are interested in any particular instrumental and want to find out more about the leasing and exclusive terms then get in contact with me through here or my email and we can take it from there.\\n\\nrtypemusic89@gmail.com",

        "description": "The UK hip/hop scene has never been more illuminated by mainstream lights than it is today. Whether its the steady-paced poetry of hip-hop or the accelerated energy of grime, the UK charts will host singles from it's own artists every week; some of which have began to spread over the pond to the US.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nUtilising both genres, is West-London rapper WKB. Listening to 'Paradox', which appears on Noel Clarke's feature film \u201c4:3:2:1\u201d, its clear that he can spit at a grime tempo and his voice matches the style. The same applies to Daily Medicine, although I think this track does more to emphasise WKB's voice with a darker beat behind it.\\u2028\\u2028 Perhaps more beguiling to a wider audience are tracks such as Trust Is A Gamble and Fallen Soldiers. These exhibit more hip-hop elements, although there is still a discernible grime tone. Trust Is A Gamble allows WKB to offer listeners some urban poetry: \u201cF**k love, I put the cuffs on Cupid, 'cos out in these streets, man, trust is useless. I see a dark face, I'm in a dark place, I make dark movements so I leave a dark trace.\u201d \\n\\nLyrics are a strong part of WKB's material; I detect aspects of Taskforce and Orifice Vulgatron (Foreign Beggars) on this.\\u2028\\u2028Moving even closer to the mainstream are Your World and Touch Me, which are both complete with a sung chorus from a female artist with interjections from our MC. In both tracks the theme seems to be love and heartache: \u201cIf a shank don't tear your heart then love will, so then I guess that means I'm in trouble. I been through it all, from street fights to bar brawls but I'm facing the toughest fight above all.\u201d (Touch Me). These verses, again of a more hip-hop nature, work very well in setting a poignant, street-life scene which is ever relevant in WKB's music.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nFor new listeners I would recommend Trust Is A Gamble and Touch Me as I feel these are where WKB is at his best. Although the grime works well (and its important to vary from one style) a slower tempo gives him time to express his thoughts and us a chance to listen.\\u2028\\u2028\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nReview by Davey Woods. \\n\\n[Twitter - @DaveyWoods89]",

Luis' musical background is heavily influenced by hip-hop due to the atmosphere of his birth town (home to a US army base) until -still very young- at the mid of the 90's, techno and house music touched on him; he fell in love with both styles. Initially as a guest of two great friends and Madrid's prominent DJs: Oscar Blue and Carlos Areste (PHASE INSANE REC), they nurtured and encouraged him to dedicate himself to music and later gave him his first opportunities to begin his career in his local town. However, Lu\u00eds moved to London in 2008, where his path was paved for a life dedicated to electronic music. From this period, it's worth highlighting amongst others, shows at EGG, Shoreditch, Crucifix Lane, Basin House, Caf\u00e9 1001, n5 Cavendish Sq. or Aquarium, all in the capital city. He has appeared at Cartulis Day, FACT, SHAKE IT, This is not serious , Smooth, Leading Astray and floreplay at Tresor Berlin all well known club nights and now witness to his talent. Especial mention to Smooth Fundays, a personal, quality project, an event exclusively about music where the artist explores his most intimate side.Currently resident dj Leading Astray\\n\\n\\nA lover of techno infused deep house styles, Luis is always ready to make people have a great time!!!",

As a teenager back in the mid to late Eighties, I was spinning Sythni-pop/80\u2019s Soul / Electro and Hip Hop on a pair of prehistoric turntables and listening into various underground radio stations. During my teenage years, although club entry wasn't easy, being younger than most of the crowd, I managed to charm my way in to some of Londons biggest names in the London Underground House scene including Philip Salon's Busby's, Shoom at The Fitness Centre, Astoria, Charing Cross road to name a few!! It was about this time that I went out and bought my first pair of turntables with a pitch slider and started to trawl record shops in Soho to buy and find more music to mix together and it was at this time that my love of house music really began.\\n\\nThis was the beginning of something special, and my introduction to the House scene: listening and playing tunes from Marshall Jefferson, Ralphi Rosario, and Steve Hurley to name a few. I started to attend the Raves of the late 80's and early 90's including ' Sunrise , Biology and Genesis and attending Warehouse parties meeting successful Promoters and DJ's from the scene. I was listening to more and more of this style of music and how the DJ\u2019s including Kid Batchelor,Danny Rampling,Tony Humpries and Louie Vega were blending the tunes together seamlessly. House music and the rave scene had exploded and I was going out clubbing most week nights and weekends: listening to house music, spinning tunes at private after party\u2019s, dj-ing various underground parties including Yikes in Slough and clubs and bars in South London. By the mid nineties, my passion for house music had really taken off!\\n\\nNow nearly 3 decades on after I started mixing, I am still around on the club circuits, and still playing out at clubs including London's \\",

Funk, wrapped in the silky smooth vibrations of positivity, Kehmak is entirely original in his stylings. From an eager 14 year old making up funny rhymes with his friends, to winning a Jack Richardson London Music award, and working with Grammy nominated artist Pusha T, Kehmak has come a long way in 15 years of honing his craft. One of the founding members of TreeTop Entertainment, Kehmak and his bredren have opened stages for some of Hip Hop\u2019s most prolific artists. Kehmak has released 2 full length projects and one EP. In 2013 he dropped The Late Night Show, a fun, silly, and completely immature project. In 2014, Kehmak released Revenge Of The Nerds, an experimental album that has the backing of a band instead of just simple production. Songs such as On My Nuts, and The Good Ol\u2019 Days have YouTube videos with upwards of 24000 views. Kehmak recently followed that up in 2016, with the release of Old Soul EP. A mature and unpredictable body of work that touches on none of the obvious Hip Hop themes. 2017 is gearing up to be a huge year for Kehmak. Plus, he has a duel project in the wings waiting to be released. Return Of The Mak, and Mak To The Future are both a clever play on his stage name, and are sure to keep building up his already impressive fan base. Kehmak continues to experiment with sound on his new music, fusing Dance, RnB, and Pop with his upbeat lyrics. Go check out his newest music video Steal The Show on Facebook or YouTube today!",

With her traditional straight Jazz Hop genre mixed with current emotional wording/lyrical topics and language CARMEN channels her influences of Monk, Amy Winehouse, Jazz instrumentals, Tribe Called Quest and J Dilla which can be clearly heard throughout her material. \\n\\nOriginally born in small town Shrewsbury, CARMEN first became involved with music when classically trained on the flute which she still carries into her music with her love for the flute and saxophone, remedying the mass opinion from the younger generation that classical/jazz instruments are less interesting.\\n \\nCurrently continuing to songwrite, over the next couple of months with an increasing following and a growing Jazz Hop scene sparked, CARMEN is a young artist to watch. \\n\\nFor all UK inquiries contact: carmenleesgreen163@gmail.com \\nContact number: 07582723494 \\nArtists website: https://soundcloud.com/carmenlees-green\\u2028Artists social media: Facebook https://www.facebook.com/carmenleesgreenmusic/ \\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/carmenleesgreen/",

Lego started learning the piano keyboard when he was 5 years old, at the age of 10, he moved to England with his family, and started attending piano lessons to continue his horning his music skills, His move to England at an early stage of life started the journey on the road to his phenomenal musical Journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 10, he started composing music on his piano, most of the time just playing any sorts of melodies of existing songs and incorporating his own flavour into them, this enabled him to find an interest in composing music, at the age of 15, Lego was introduced to a beat-making software by a friend of his who was a DJ at the local youth centre, from there onwards he developed his skills and started producing R\\u0026B, pop and hip-hop beats. With his mother's support for his love of music, he went on to study music technology at Reading TVU.\\r\\n\\r\\nLego is inspired to find his own sound that unifies his productions that reflects his musical roots in soul, R\\u0026B, gospel, Hip-Hop and pop.

Arturs went on to graduate from the London College of Music where he went to on to gain a degree in Music Technology.\\n\\n\\nArturs cites a number of influences including acts like, the Prodigy, Skrillex  and Deadmau5. As well as listening to music outside of EDM, such as grunge, Punk and Hip Hop, K-wolf has always been interested in using sounds from other genres and incorporating  them into his own unique style. \\n\\nHe is now looking to network with other producers and singers in order to expand his presence on the Electro scene, having also produced Dubstep and more recently experimented with Trap, he would welcome offers of collaborations from individuals working within those genres, as well as any singers or producers working outside of EDM.\\n\\nTo contact regarding online and national press, radio, live bookings and other enquiries, please email kwolfofficial@gmail.com.

Started with 4 to the floor garage which evolved into more of the 2 step garage before the year 2000. Always a dedicated hip hop fan i bought the odd hip hop album but never really got to grips with the mixing element until i started buying more singles with instrumentals and acapellas on the vinyl. After the year 2001 i completely stopped garage to focus on hip hop and Rnb and haven't looked back. I have in my humble opinion a fair hip hop and Rnb collection of tunes with a lot of battle records from America and mashups that i play when i DJ out. \\n\\nSo from time to time i may make a little mash up with 2 or 3 tunes, mix it up in my studio add some base and add to the mp3 collection.\\n\\nMy home set up is Technics 1210s x 2, CDJ 2000 Nexus x 2 and DJM 2000 Nexus mixer.

He has a new EP, Dedication, getting air play in Europe and the USA and he has been snapped up to appear on this year's Unsigned UK Tour which once had Adele on its roster. Tierz currently has three music videos on YouTube two of which have hit over 1000 views and one over 2000 views and he is working on a new video for his track 'Candyman' which has proved to be a hit amongst followers. From appearing at open mic sessions in pubs Tierz has moved up in the rapping world - he is now managed by Smashed It Management a management company based in the north of England and being sponsored by Money Baggs clothing. The Unsigned UK Tour will be a major step forward for the young rapper who lives near Edenbridge and there is the possibility of a trip to the USA. He is now appearing at important London venues and there is a full length album of his music in the pipeline. But there is one obstacle to the meteoric rise of Tierz among the rapping fraternity - he can't get any bookings in his home town or in Kent or Surrey. \\",

After devoting myself to rock and metal early on in my life my focus has shifted more to Electronic music since Uni life introduced me to some awesome electro musicians and producers. I was amazed how much depth electronic music could add to pretty much any other genre I wanted to experiment with, wether it was hard-rock, hip-hop, classical or dubstep. It was like I'd discovered a machine brimming with power just waiting to be unleashed! \\n\\nI'm always a believer that fusing styles and concepts from many musical genres is the best way to create music that is exciting, original and hopefully as inspiring to listen to as it is to create.\\n\\nI'm always creating new tracks, in varying styles and across genres, and always on the look-out for talented collaborators - from singers/musicians to producers. Message me :)\\n\\nComments and suggestions always welcomed too - music is as much about the audience that wants to hear it, as it is about self-expression.\\n\\nAll tracks now available for free download.\\n\\nPeace x\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Jon-Nicoll/145340668829862",

        "description": "Baliva is a man who proves that the scripture is true: with faith the size of a mustard seed, one can move mountains. The Zimbabwe-born hip-hop artist has gained a large following in recent years in the UK for his inspirational hip-hop that blends the melodious sounds of jazz and soul in every rhyme. His 2015 album Imperfect was funded by the good faith of his fans via a wildly successful Kickstarter-style campaign, and his name has spread across the country thanks to the support of mainstream gospel radio. In short, Baliva is making a believer of hip-hop fans all over the UK.\\n\\nImperfect is an inspirational album inspired by Baliva\u2019s own journey to Christ. As he says, \u201cthe album was inspired by a desire to share my journey of accepting that my life is not necessarily perfect but it is still great because the most important thing about life is that we are loved and accepted by God\u201d. His faith has been a guide in his life, and it\u2019s through his music that he inspires it in others. From performing at schools and on the streets to engaging in radio interviews at the UK\u2019s leading gospel radio station, Premier Gospel, Baliva shares his story with passion and peace. \\n\\nIt is, perhaps, this unique combination of traits \u2013 passion and peace \u2013 that has inspired so many fans. It was with their loyal support that Imperfect even came to be. The album gave Baliva the opportunity to work with Grammy award-winning producer Tony Stone, for the second time in 3 years. \u201cI met Tony Stone through Wade-O Radio back in 2008,\u201d he explains, after the producer announced he wanted to work with new and independent artists. The resulting single, \u201cOn a Mission\u201d, was released in 2012, and the two joined forces once again for the release of Imperfect in 2015.\\n\\nCollaboration and the support of fans and other artists has helped Baliva in more ways than one. He is a favorite of the DJ\u2019s at Premier Gospel, and has performed with artists including Just Jon and MOBO-nominated artist Ricardo Williams. He is currently working with a German producer on a jazz-soul release, and says \u201cI work with producers all over the world thanks to the internet which means I get to tap into various influences\u201d. As he continues to share his story and passion with peace and a unique flavor to UK hip-hop, he is sure to continue growing his fan base and inspiring people all over the world. \\n\\nJust as Imperfect came as the results of an outpour of support from inspired fans, Baliva continues to make an impact with help from his following, many of whom have discovered his music online as well. With his Patron subscriptions, he ensures fans that he\u2019s able to keep creating authentic music independently, without the need to turn to record labels for pay. Subscribers pay an easy \u00a31.99 a month and in return, Baliva releases one new song or article. As he says, \u201cIt's amazing how a such a small amount of people giving as little as \u00a31.99 a month can all add up to allow me to make a full time living making music.\u201d With just this support, he\u2019s better able to bring new music and blogs to the public and keep his vision alive. \\n\\nIn the coming year, he seeks to continue recording new songs, connect more intimately with fans around the world, and collaborate with even more artists in the jazz and soul scenes. He continues to promote Imperfect and the message of Christ.\\nHis latest album, Imperfect, is available on iTunes as well as at balivamusic.com/imperfect.

I believe what makes me unique to other DJ's is my ability to play the right song at the right time, sometimes I can sense what song will make everyone go crazy at that specific moment, this ability has helped me to get regular bookings in UK and France (functions and festivals).\\r\\n\\r\\nI love to create a relationship with the crowd, the crowd decides if you deserve applause, the crowd tells you if you're doing a great job on the decks so for me I've got to interact with the crowd and make sure I listen to them so I can feed their musical souls!\\r\\n\\r\\nI love to play different genres of music such as Hip Hop and R\\u0026B but you can't beat a great House song to get the crowd going or a bit of Reggaeton to get the girls wining!",

I like to fuse traditional and modern music such as jazz, soul and funk. I do this by choosing a song that I think will work and then I slice and edit the sample in logic and then play back in the EXS24 to then create an original piece of music. For creating drums I use audio samples to create layers for kicks and snares and then I play the drums in the EXS24 as I prefer to play the drums rather than draw them in.",

        "description": "London trio Your Girl Likes Us is the combination of an MC, a Singer and producer. When they met in college they experimented by fusing their individual musical styles. With Laurie\u2019s beats Courtney \u201cCD Spinz\u201d Dore\u2019s bars and Suzi\u2019s soaring vocals they\u2019ve created a fresh sound which they describe as dirty pop. \\r\\n\\r\\nLaurie\u2019s beats are encompassed by his meticulous attention to detail and fiendish behavior. His unhinged megalomaniacal nature ensures his control and intention throughout the writing and recording process. With influences of rock and breakbeat, with the sporadic splattering of FUNK, this escapist producer throws together a medley of genres for the band members to interpret.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen faced with these experimental beats, CD Spinz is able to implant his undeniable style. His verses are sometimes reminiscent of a jazz soloist, floating over the percussive elements of the beats as if he were skipping stones on the sea with each line being the smoothest of pebbles. CD\u2019s departure from generic rap and grime comes with him  bravely and consciously straying away from and avoiding the ignorant egocentric stigma attached to them, without losing his edge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding it all together Suzi writes melodies with staggering spontaneity. Offering punchy stabs, flowing harmonies and uplifting crescendo's. She moves from strength to strength killing the mic with the savage brutality of a Soldier. Schooled in 50s jazz, 90s hip hop and RnB, she is the perfect garnish atop an expertly executed cocktail.",

Generally the style is a mix of abstract, instrumental and electronic hip-hop / glitch-hop sounds, mixed occassionally with IDM / dubstep / [some other shite sub-genre name] when I can be arsed. Oh, and please dont call it Post Hip-Hop - this classification offends me.\\n\\nBest bet is just to try out the mixes and see what you think, they are quite varied so there must be something you might like in there, otherwise I deduct you must have audio retardation. All mixes are 320 sound quality and downloadable, so no excuses people.\\n\\nI would very much appreciate comments / criticism / insane hatred where necessary to find out what I am doing right or how I could improve. Most of all, please enjoy my mixes and remember to support the lovely artists who create these wonderful landscapes.\\n\\n",

        "description": "\u201cMy musical style comes from influences \\u0026 experiences throughout life. My childhood \\u0026 teen years were not the easiest, so a lot of my vocal tone in certain songs, comes from those experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a kid I listened to a lot of hip-hop which gave me the lyrical side of my style, while a lot of the \u201cbig voices\u201d in music such as Stevie Wonder, Terence Trent D\u2019Arby, Otis Redding \\u0026 Aretha Franklin have been my tutors on how to place the voice in certain songs and how to sing from the gut.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll I\u2019ve ever done with my music to develop a different style from my influences, is to be true to myself and put what I feel into the music, not what is selling at the moment, which is what some artists do. Many people try to write songs exactly like the top ten artists and I see that as not being true to yourself. It is essentially just trying to make a quick buck by sounding like what\u2019s \u201chot\u201d at the minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like to think that my live performances are unique because I give my all in each one I want to engage the crowd not just sing for myself\u2026\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2026Said Nathan in an interview for The Stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be fair to say that musically Nathan has been having a fantastic year building a grassroots fan base of all ages and performing at prestigious venues including The Jazz Cafe, where he opened for soul divas Jazmine Sullivan \\u0026 Leela James, Ronnie Scotts (as a guest vocalist for a year), The Troubadour, The Pigalle, The Boisdale, Floriditas\u2026 the list goes on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNathan set the Luminaire on fire recently, opening for award nominee Melanie Fiona and taking her crowd by surprise with soul lifting performance alongside his six piece band!\\r\\n\\r\\nHis debut album \u201cStudent Of Life\u201d is now availible on Itunes following the SOL EP released earlier last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stand out 1st single \u201dReach Out (You\u2019ve Got a Friend)\u201d attained a number 15 peak in Music Week\u2019s Urban Chart with a fantastic remix from SedSoul and the follow up single \u201dFor You\u201d, also remixed by the trusted SedSoul crew, was a Music Week top twenty club hit.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe performed a live acoustic set on The Joanne Good Show (BBC Radio London) and was invited back (on air) to perform with his band. On 22nd May Nathan blew Jo\u2019s listening audience away with his performance. Jo was proud to say that she had never had a reaction like that with listeners texting \\u0026 emailing in all throughout the show to find out more about him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe performance at the Secret Garden Party, in the summer of 2011, was hailed as the best debut act they had seen since the festival was born.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year it looks like a talented young artist is on his way to a break through, with UK Soul Power!",

        "description": "A native Londoner born to Jamaican parents, Doom Man grew up in a household where music was highly appreciated and passionately listened to. As a young boy, Doom Man was used to hearing his mothers collections listening to Soul, Funk, Reggae, Jazz \\u0026 the Motown classics. His father would listening to artists like Sade, Mantronix, Rob Base \\u0026 DJ EZ Rock and Big Daddy Cane.\\n\\nHe first started taking himself seriously with group called The Dungeoneers, calling himself (The Assassin) but in later years they separated. This was small but crucial turning point that gave Doom the opportunity to gain control over his creative outlet and develop his individual style \\u0026 flair. In September 2000, Doom and his brother TK created Da Marvel. The concept derived from the well-known Marvel Superhero's characters. Da Marvel performed at clubs around the UK and ran successful weekly shows on Freeze FM and Internet radio station Major FM.\\n\\nNo Apologies signed Doom Man in 2004 and got straight to work on the Doom\u2019s Day album which was never released, and unfortunately Doom left the independent Label in 2007. Dooms music has already landed him in Konami\u2019s computer game called Crime Life: Gang Wars. The game features D12 who provide music for the title track and whose members lend their voices and likeness to the game. The game was released in November 2005. For more information, visit the website at http://www.konami-crimelife.com\\n\\nDoom has performed some of his tracks with high accolade. His towering presence and bold vocals joined forces with beat-box phenomenon Killa Kela at Wembley Arena in 2004. He was the opening act for De La Soul in Prague and for Onyx in Slovakia. Doom also performed at Maida Vale Studios for BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra. As well as other performances in the UK and Europe, Doom took to the mic on the main stage and wooed a crowd of 20,000 at the Lovebox Weekender summer 2005 festival alongside Groove Armada, Milo and many more.\\n\\nIn 2008 Doom Man returned to his underground roots by releasing his third mixtape 'Until That Day Volume Zero' through his own label Onslaught Recordings. Also performing with the likes of Harvey, Asher D, DJ Ironik and Scottie B all over England and Spain. He has now been supported by Bristol\u2019s biggest band Dr Meaker who also produced Doom's first single 'What Does It Say About You' released in June 2009 and with them performed at Glastonbury that same year. \\n\\nIn 2010 Doom Man has full control over his music as a writer and CEO of Onslaught Recordings, working with an array of producers in the UK and overseas. His 2nd release was the Deep Tech House club banger \u2018Don\u2019t Talk To Me\u2019 produced by Yonurican out of Chicago, who he got in contact with via myspace. Then dropping his highly anticipated 4th mixtape \u2018Don\u2019t Talk To Me Vol. 1\u2018 has keep himself relevant in the scene. \\n\\nWorking on various projects and widening his talent to TV, gaining a small role in Nic Auerbach\u2019s film \u2018The Big I am\u2018 which starred notorious actors such as Michael Madsen, Vincent Regan \\u0026 Steven Berkoffhe.  In 2011 Doom Man released his 3rd single \u2018Celebrate Life Part 2\u2019 featuring Seyi Shay, then in 2012 released a free Hip Hop EP entitled \u2018The Appeal\u2019 which is also an alternative alias Doom has created for himself. \\n\\n2013 Doom Man released three singles, See Me Strive, Feel Fine and Believe It through he\u2019s own label Onslaught Recordings and using PIAS for distribution.  All three videos are now available to watch on Youtube or DoomManVEVO.  Now in 2014 Doom is preparing to release his first four track EP entitled \u2018Gloria Hossana.

A well known and respected figure in the urban music scene, his lyrical ability has made him a marvel to the Bangladeshi community World Wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nSh8s\u2122 was the founder and lead member of the 2005 Asian Invasian\u2122 underground hip hop group, one of the first groups formed in the Bethnal Green area at the time, consisting of 10 members, recording songs that include 'Whatcha Gonna Do' and 'Taking You Down'. The group took the UK Asian underground scene by storm. Despite being short lived, the echoes that it has left behind have helped to shape the Asian music scene of today.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007 he began to pursue solo projects recording songs that include 'Tales Of A Sinful World' and 'Corrupted Bengal', digging deeper and harder into the roots of subjects covering poverty, inequality, freedom and liberation, educating himself in the history of mankind and about the heritage passed down to him by his fore-fathers. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2008 Sh8s\u2122 took a revolutionary step, getting together with a group of collectives to form Deshi Movement\u2122. Taking pride in being a third generation British Bangladeshi, he started amalgamating both languages to create bilingual songs depicting the struggles and hardships faced by the young generation growing up in today's British society. He has gained a lot of success with songs such as 'Keep It Pushin' and 'Untouchables'.\\r\\n\\r\\n2009 was the year of Konk Bak Recordz\u2122, an independent record label, established solely by Sh8s\u2122 as a base from where he could branch out his music as a solo artist, taking a giant leap to break through to the commercial market. Still in the early stages of creation we can only imagine what this young innovator has in store for the future.",

Growing up and seeing his father\u2019s passion for music being a session guitarist and backing popular Reggae artists such as, Maxi Priest, Michael Profit, Everton Blender and more, this is something that not only inspired BookemDB\u2019s love of music, but also acts as his motivation to constantly produce and compose new tracks of all genres. His older brother\u2019s own musical projects only acts as further motivation. The family interest in music means that BookemDB\u2019s own work is bursting with the energy and texture of the many sounds and genres he has heard while growing up. While his music is mainly based on the Urban Hip Hop/ R'n'B genre, his versatile interests ensure his success in other genres such as House, Soul, Funk, Jazz and Reggae, as well as many others. The delivery and sound in BookemDB\u2019s songs can be described as energetic with a bounce: and something that is both epic and current, citing his current musical inspirations as (From 1st to last) Dr. Dre, Marvin Gaye, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Timberland, Pharell Williams and Kanye West. BookemDB produces tracks with his own distinct, yet instantly familiar sound.\\r\\nStarting as a hobby in his younger years, BookemDB\u2019s love of music saw him in the studio for the first time at only 13. His musical ambition has seen him explore a number of musical ventures. He attended South Thames College where he studied Music Technology, which only widened his musical skills and interests. At the end of this 4-year course, BookemDB worked hard in the studio as well as networking, attending award shows and gigs around the London area. Having both the knowledge and practical experience in music, he is now setting out to make his mark on the music world. His first EP is soon to be released for 2014, comprising his best tracks and collaborations.\\r\\nSo far in his career, BookemDB has worked with a plethora of up and coming artists, such as rappers Myles Brown, Workz, Levels and EzMan; singers Glenn Vine, Amanda, Evie and JoJo. In particular, he often collaborates with his brother, EzMan, creating tunes that keep everyone hooked, entertained and interested in what more\u2019s to come.\\r\\nWith the upcoming releases of new Tracks, Albums and Mix Tapes, BookemDB will be found in the studio working tirelessly collaborating and producing for himself, plus his and other artists.\\r\\n",

His organic urban style has the potential to break that all important crossover to mainstream music without lossing the intregrity many arstist are faced with today. Born and raised in the UK, Kam uses a combination of musical ability, personality and good looks to attract his target audience. His inspirational unique sound catchy (melodies and old school hip hop beats) encapsulates the chracteristics of a seductive fusion in musical genres.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing from a creative background, Kam's earliest musical aspirations began in his primary school where he and his friends formed a group to perform at a fund raising event. Never really taking music seriously until the group received a positive response; this led him to believe that this passing phase was more than just a dream. He and fellow group members practiced at every opportunity rapping in their school playground and on the streets in their local area. Unfortunately, after the hype died down and promises were left unfulfilled Kam became very frustrated. Despite having the vision he felt that there was a gap in the UK music industry and the group members decided it was best to split.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever in the mid 90's Kam's musical interest became more than collecting music album as a hobby and listening to memorable hip hop albums such as Snoop's 'doggy style'. For the first time Kam became aware of what other rappers had to say and realized that he shared aspect of the same struggle. He admired the art form and found himself reciting the words of other rappers and began writing experimental verses and practicing his rhyming skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time Kam's cousins decided to start up a rap group and Kam joined in developing his musical verses even further and attended the group's regular music sessions. These high standards were met with friendly competition, very high standard and rapping into a built in mic tape recorder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs hip hop became more accessible so did Kam's musical interest and passion. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\",

        "description": "Having been around for over 2 decades,. Starting his career as a Pirate Radio dj in the mid 80's my style evolved with the various musical genres Dub, Rare Groove, Hip Hop, Disco to early House and Drum and Bass. I remember back in the days when raves were promoted primarily by flyers printed on actual paper and distributed to record shops that had bricks-and mortar storefronts lol you could go and visit that a \u201cDJ profile\u201d used to just mean someone\u2019s name and their affiliations to rave collectives\u2026and, later to record labels. Sure, those DJs that were big enough to have an agent probably already had a paragraph or two about them written down somewhere, but they circulated in a smaller, closed circuit of \u201cprofessionals\u201dI am very passionate about sharing with the audience what i think are the greatest records of the moment or what i think are timeless classics. \u201cTo me, music is a universal language. It\u2019s so diverse and speaks to every person differently. The way it's presented to the audience is just as important as the actual music\\",

        "description": "Artist Biography: Prophecy\\n\\nProphecy, an up and coming emcee from North London, is a fresh and cutting edge artist that is set to bring the essence of rhyme back to your I-Pods and Beats by Dre\u2019s.  A raw and uncut hybrid of grime and rap, with an emphasis on the fundamental techniques of the craft: sharp delivery, similes, metaphors and vivid imagery. His intricate rhyme schemes and patterns ensure originality and authenticity amongst a lot of the monotony of the genre today. His catalogue of music mainly consists of fast paced flows and hard hitting punch-lines that entwine effortlessly into a synchronized barrage of ferocious rhetoric, with substance ranging from conscious and political, to bravado infused street tales of crime and everyday hardships. His verses and delivery consistently trigger flashbacks to some of the greatest MC\u2019s to ever do it.  Names like Kool G Rap, Canibus and Crooked I have been used to describe his rapping style and skills.  As well as this, he is the founder of Black Banner Movement, which is an organization based on creative talents; in all areas of art, music and film, supporting real, \u2018genuine\u2019 music.\\n\\nJanuary 2013 saw Prophecy win the prestigious \u2018All Out Show\u2019 with Choice FM\u2019s very own Hip Hop legend, Dj 279, as well as Hot Barz\u2019s Thad Boogie (Big Promo), forming part of the judge panel. Also in January was the digital release of his free mixtape entitled \u2018Black Banner Movement Presents: Grindin\u2019 \\u0026 Graftin\u2019 \u2013 Prophecy Vs Dot Rotten Vol. 1\u2019 through Bandcamp.Com. It is the first installment of the \u2018Prophecy Vs\u2019 series. The mixtape was received to critical acclaim and burgeoning hype about an actual full length LP.  The first half of 2013 should also bring the release of Prophecy\u2019s EP \u2013 \u2018Money \\u0026 Music\u2019.  March 2013 will see Prophecy support the legendary Brooklyn, New York MC, Sean Price (aka Rukus of Heltah Skeltah) on his \u2018Mic Tyson\u2019 album tour at North London\u2019s The Garage venue.",

        "description": "Short Men / Tall Tales - a comedy podcast, consisting of comedy conversations between radio star King Karamel and Hip Hop Karaoke host Bobby Champagne Jr that, each week, sees them delving back into their pasts and dredging up a selection of their most ridiculous (but 100% true) anecdotes.  May contain strong language and adult themes, will definitely contain awkward and embarrassing recollections!\\n\\nIf you are searching for the height of podcast comedy - you have taken a wrong, but intriguing turn which may well end in you being devoured by a redneck cult, a risk worth taking.\\n\\nAllow us to introduce the stars of this weekly comedy podcast!  Firstly there\u2019s Reprezent Radio DJ and fashionable man-about-town King Karamel - or Munya Chawawa [*good name] to his parents.  Munya spent his childhood in Zimbabwe, where he accumulated a range of frankly-unbelievable stories, such as a brief foray into running with a local gang (until a stray kick in the bollocks set him on the straight and narrow) and an unfortunate incident that saw his dog Charlie being eaten by his neighbours, which must have been traumatic for the young \u2018Pimp Slicky-Slick\u2019 (another apparent \u2018aka\u2019, which we\u2019re almost certain he\u2019s never been called), but has proved to be gold-dust for a comedy podcast.  Relocating to badlands of Norwich, our soon-to-be Vlogger had to navigate the choppy waters of a god-fearing father, with almost as many aliases as his son - and a surely-unhealthy obsession with the women and, it turns out, men of WWE\u2026\\n\\nAnd whilst this is all great material for a comedy podcast, we need someone to prise these ludicrous scenarios from Munya\u2019s memory banks, which bring us to his comedic sparring-partner - Bobby Champagne Jr\\n\\nBobby grew up in South London\u2019s answer to Zimbabwe, by which of course we mean Wimbledon - and whilst his youth was mercifully free of dog-eating, his life took no less a bizarre path, thanks to a self-sabotaging sense of humour, and love of showing off which saw him play in a number of appallingly-named bands (e.g. \u2018The Coathanger Abortions\u2019 and \u2018DJ Rhythm Bitch, Nazi on Heat and his Unwanted Pregnancies\u2019), and as a result find himself in liaisons with a number of appallingly-attired girls.  These days, Bobby hosts the legendary London club night Hip Hop Karaoke, and as his day job interviews pop stars - and as a result just about manages to hold his own (not a euphemism) in the comedy podcast stakes with a mixture of horrifyingly embarrassing teenage anecdotes and no-less embarrassing brushes with the stars...\\n\\nOh\u2026 and regarding the name of this weekly comedy podcast \u2018Short Men / Tall Tales\u2019 - both Bobby and Munya are keen to point out to any [potential] female listeners that they aren\u2019t that short.  And if they\u2019re less keen to disclose their actual heights, they want it on record that they\u2019re both taller than \u2018most' women..\\n\\n\\n\u201cPodcast Comedy Gold!\u201d - The Chinese Independent Press\\n\\n\u201cBest Comedy Podcast in a .5cm Radius\u201d - Digital Spy\\n\\n\u201cA Comedy Podcast with a Real Sharp \\u0026 Rusty Edge\u201d - Mechanics Weekly",

        "description": "There\u2019s really only two places a DJ partnership should form; the dancefloor or a record shop. Fidel and Julian met in the latter. Black Market Records in Soho, to be precise. Drawn together by their love of house, East London resident and underground clubbing mainstay Fidel invited Romanian music obsessive Julian to join him back to back. A flurry of hyped sets later and the pair were shaking the bones of world famous club night Trade for its Final 25th birthday at The Egg, London.\\n\\nAcidman was born. Its debut came bubbling from the decks of Dalston Superstore, East London\u2019s premiere underground hub. Robsoul Recordings\u2019 Jade Cox and Junior Boy\u2019s own Terry Farley were among the special guests before the duo moved on to the Trapeze Basement club in Shoreditch, dividing their time between the residency and unforgettable parties in Palermo, Italy.\\n\\nHouse might be having a mainstream resurgence, but the shudder of a crisp 4x4 has long echoed in the hearts of Fidel and Julian. Born in London\u2019s East End, Fidel bought his first set of decks at 17. A firm fixture on the 90s club scene with a residency at Turnmills\u2019 now defunct legendary night \u2018Melt\u2019, his productions with DJ Karim for house label Tripoli Trax were regularly championed by industry hero Carl Cox. \\n\\nFidel has gone on to work with global club brands Ministry of Sound, Pacha and Space in Ibiza and has graced the decks at famed clubs around the globe, from China to Israel, Hong Kong to Europe, America and beyond, working alongside internationally acclaimed and highly sought after DJs including DJ Sneak, Terry Farley, The 2 Bears, Junior Sanchez, Sven Vath, Derrick May, Leftfield\u2019s Paul Daley, Eddie Amador and Halo+Hippee.\\n\\nJulian Murariu grew up in Romania. Raised on a diet of hip hop, he discovered house thanks to DJ Sneak\u2019s genre-defining Chicago house set at Sunwaves festival on Romania\u2019s Black Sea Beaches. Inspired by what he heard, Julian began throwing parties in his small home town before a move to Munich and his subsequent involvement in the Harry Klein scene inspired him to pursue a career in DJing for good. \\n\\nAcidman sees Fidel and Julian combine their passions to create the ultimate house-head experience. Crafting the very best in US and European house, it\u2019s a carefully curated party that puts clubbers first. Mixing bouncing, jacking 4x4 with a penchant for disco, fresh from a fine lineage of influences including DJ Sneak, Phil Weeks, Green Velvet Butch, Martinez Brothers, Point G, Moodymann, Ricardo Villalobos, DJ Wild and Terry Farley.\\n\\nFrom underground warehouse raves to sunlit festival stages, big room celebrations to carefully curated residencies, the Acidman sound is about two heads working as one, cut with the old and bringing in the new. Long live house.",

        "description": "\u201cI\u2019m more of a rapper than a poet, though it\u2019s because of poetry that I became a rapper. Since I was nine \u2013 after listening to hip hop \u2013 I wanted to rap, but before that I used to be writing poetry. It made me happy, putting words together, even just a couple of lines. I wouldn\u2019t call it a talent, I would call it \u2018practice makes perfect\u2019. Every since I understood what life was about, when I was about seven, I have always wanted to help people out. You could say I\u2019m a helper, a healer, I want to see people get treated equally in this world. Music is the remedy of hatred . People usually respond well to music and poetry, and my lyrics are short and to the point.\u201d",

        "description": "Steve Williamson, composer and saxophonist, formally began his musical career reading Composition and Arrangement at the Guildhall School of Music.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescribed by Art Blakey as a 'prime mover' on the saxophone, Williamson has enjoyed learning and playing with some of the greatest, from reggae legends, Misty in Roots, funk luminary George Clinton, folk hero Ali Farka Toure to jazz supremes, Steve Coleman and Donald Byrd.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWilliamson's influences have ranged from Bartok and Charlie Parker to Public Enemy. These influences have been brought to life by strong female presences, including the vocalists Abbey Lincoln, Cassandra Wilson \\u0026 Jhelissa Anderson. \\r\\n\\r\\nWilliamson's 'technically startling' and award winning debut album, 'A Waltz for Grace' revealed an artist of 'sensitivity, tradition and true originality' and saw the reopening of the legendary Verve label to mark its release. Continually resisting both industry and audience expectations to continue purely in the Jazz tradition, Williamson continued to innovate in his subsequent composition exploring the different genres of funk, rap, R\\u0026B, hip hop and drum and bass. A second composition based album, 'Rhyme Time', noted for its harmonic ingenuity, marked a movement towards the 'more abstract jazz funk exploits' of the influential New York M-Base collective. Williamson then discovered a mentor in Kazuhiko Yanagida of Nippon Phonogram and recorded his third album, 'A Journey To Truth' with Grammy award winning hip-hop crew, The Roots. This enjoyed successful releases in the USA \\u0026 Japan but, along with Williamson's fourth album, 'Biyah's Building Blocks', remains as yet unreleased in the UK. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as touring extensively with his own bands, the Steve Williamson quartet and the funk-inspired, That Fuss Was Us, Williamson's live credits include: Goldie, Jazz Warriors, Archie Shepp, Gil Scott Heron \\u0026 Guru. \\r\\n\\r\\nWilliamson's current composition is an embodiment of a life long study of harmonic theory, particularly the discipline of geometry in nature and its interrelation in the structured freedom of musical form. He will be performing and releasing both a retrospective of works, as well as his current composition, in the coming year. ",

        "description": "The idea came from North London producer Logan who has been producing Hip-Hop since the 90s with HardHedz, Chosan and Ggrim (Choice FM - DJ 279 \\u0026 Radio 1 - Tim Westwood). Inspired by Our Version of Events, the debut album by Emeli Sand\u00e9, Logan reconnected with fellow North Londoner Artcha (Now That's What I Call A Mixtape Vol.1) to reproduce the entire album with a new rap focus. After a few conversations the pair sketched out the concepts for each song realising the original titles would be perfect inspiration to write stories, antidotes and just good old-fashioned lyrical expression. This is far from a straight mix-tape, rapping over instrumentals. Instead Logan has hand crafted new versions of the songs with the kind of detail a producer would bring to a completely new album. Artcha has pushed the bar exploring concepts of infidelity, bullying, media betrayal and other social issues. The lead singles will be Lifetime 2.0 and Clown 2.0. These are two songs from either side of the musical spectrum. My Version of Events is truly a diverse project and captures the balance of classic song writing with edgy concepts and a powerful delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nTracks Mixed \\u0026 Produced by Logan for 3rd Reality",

DJ\u2019s such as DJ Big L, French Kiss DJ EZ to name a few have been \\n\\nbig influences\\n\\nFrom 2005 he had been DJ\u2019ing at house parties and small lounging events \\n\\nuntil March 2011 when he had his first breakthrough DJ\u2019ing at a Massive \\n\\nevent called \u2018Ghana Independence\u2019. An annual event Hosted by \\n\\nAkwaabaUK to celebrate Ghana\u2019s Independence Day. \\n\\nThe reaction from his set at that event gave him the first stepping stone to \\n\\nhis DJ career. Thus he became one of the official DJs of AkwaabaUK. \\n\\nHe has DJ\u2019ed at many of the nightclubs in the central of London e.g. \\n\\nAgenda, Abacus, Roxy, Pause Bar, Gable Bar, Bar 104, DR. Inks Cocktail Bar, \\n\\nPlatinum Bar, Mustard Bar etc. As well as DJ\u2019ed many events hosted by \\n\\nAkwaabaUK and other promoters. \\n\\nHis mixing ability and creativity has not only limited his skills to DJ locally \\n\\nbut also given opportunities to DJ outside the UK. Countries such as USA, \\n\\nGhana, Germany and Qatar have had a taste of him.\\n\\nHe continues to this day to excel in his skills in all genres of music: \\n\\nAfrobeats, House, Funky House, Rap/hip-hop, R\\u0026B, Bashment.\\n\\nHe quotes: My love for music is hypnotic and I love the vibe.

In 2004 he changed the style that he plays and he now concentrates on the pure underground side of House music and showing his versatility he plays everything from sultry jazzy vibes and deep house to full on tribal and tech house, minimal and techno depending on the night / festival he has been booked for and with his passion for discovering unknown artists and tracks from across the globe his sets are always fresh and exhilarating.\\r\\n\\r\\nDean has also promoted some of his own nights that have proved to be very successful.

Strikingly catchy melodies and haunting hooks will keep you transfixed in these compositions where Reggae, Hip-Hop, Electronica and Soul have all nestled themselves comfortably.  \\n\\nProducing the album is internationally acclaimed producer and dub master general GAUDI who has put his signature sheen on each track.  From the stirring revolutionary sound of \u2018NEVER LET THE SYSTEM GET YOU DOWN\u2019 to the hypnotic, transcendent groove of \u2018WHAT I COULD SEE\u2019, the album showcases Ladwa\u2019s lyrical flair and diverse musical influences.\\n\\n\u2018UNFOLDING\u2019 is an undeniably positive and conscious record with a message; a feel-good sonic journey through a kaleidoscope of musical genres, each representing a chapter in Ladwa\u2019s compendium of musical experience.\\n\\nBIO:\\nDanny Ladwa, formerly known as \u2018Lyrikool Lipz\u2019 started writing lyrics from the age of 11, and soon after discovered he had a particular talent for beat boxing.   Born in Nottingham, UK and from Indian heritage Danny spent much of his free time as a youth composing songs and soundtracks in his head, mostly on the fly.\\n\\nDanny\u2019s musical past is colorful and diverse, and he is truly an international artist who has performed in the four corners of the Globe.  Past career highlights include performing alongside \u2018Supa Mc TC Islam\u2019 (son of Afrika Bambaataa) at \u2018EcoSystem Festival\u2019 in Brazil, joining Hip Hop fusion band \u2018NOU\u2019 (One Little Indian Records) in Brighton for their UK tour, and winning a place in the UK Beatbox Championship Final. \\n\\nIn 2006 Danny collaborated with Gaudi and the Live Dub Laboratory at the Glade Festival, and Gaudi obviously liked what he saw, as this swiftly lead to more UK and European dates and Danny being featured later on Gaudi\u2019s album \u2018No Prisoners\u2019 on the track \u2018Brainwashed Again\u2019.  He recently featured on Gaudi\u2019s 13th solo album \u2018In Between Times\u2019 on the tracks \u2018Unlimited Possibilities\u2019 and \u2018Why U Wanna Run\u2019.  \\n\\nBetween 2011-2015 Danny toured internationally with Gaudi as Singer and Beatboxer playing up to 70 shows a year from Goa to Glastonbury, Panama to Japan whilst performing solo shows in Japan, Dublin and the UK.\\n\\nDanny is currently working on new material collaborating with a host of musicians and songwriters including 'Mo Pleasure' who has worked with huge names such as 'Ray Charles', 'Earth Wind \\u0026 Fire', 'Stevie Wonder' \\u0026 'Michael Jackson' to name but a few. \\n\\nContact:  mail@dannyladwa.com",

Music has always been a part of his life, from young he has been a big fan of the late Great Michael Jackson. He then moved to England with his mother in 1994 were he was thrown in the deep south west of London\u2019s crowded concrete jungle, where he gained a passion for DnB, Garage and Hip-Hop. He knew then that he wanted to be part of the new urban movement being created on the streets of London by the So Solid Crew, which Oscar knows well and to become a rapper/mc just like his favorite artist the NOTORIOUS B.I.G. With new born responsibilities in late 2008, OSCAR decided to move to Cornwall and set up a promotion company called Nu leaf Promotionz ltd, were he successfully put on events in the summer of 2009 in Newquay with the help of friends and family. Donating some of the profits to local charities e.g. Joe way, Tanya\u2019s Courage Trust, and Precious Lives Appeal. With the ambition of becoming an artist himself Oscar, Dhruv, and Bradley formed a group called Nuleaf Disciples, and they took the south west by storm with their original UK Grime and Hip-Hop sound, and with their new single \u201cGET TO KNOW YA\u201d . A big hit for the summer\u2026..!!!!! After sometime he decided to make a break from the Nuleaf Desciples and go it alone. Then in 2011 Oscar approached Alive Music Studios (based in Wadebridge, Cornwall) to record a demo CD of his songs, but little did he know that when he walked through the doors of Alive Music that this would change his life and walk out of Alive Music with a record publishing deal under Alive Music Records label. Now with his new song release called \u201cMy Town\u201d along with the ringtone available on iTunes, also the video release on Channelaka TV is now making headway in the music business. He is currently working on old and new songs to be released over the coming months, including a remix of a Song called Tweet Back original written by Wiley Artist.\\n\\nHeadline act 3 years running at Looe Music Festival\u2026 the largest Live music festival in Cornwall\\n\\n\\n\\nRead more http://www.alivemusicstudios.co.uk/cms/artist-roster/od-rapper-and-singer-songwriter-hip-hop-rap/",

Having met in English class after being fatefully plonked in alphabetical order, the duo began their forays into the worlds of DJing and production in 2013 and have dutifully never looked back -  now having already held residencies at many clubs over the past year alongside their studies together at the British Academy of New \\nMusic, the duo have set their sights on smashing 2015 after a stellar first year in the business. \\nHaving been quickly seduced by the upfront sub and frantic toplines of new school trap music after being raised on a stable diet of rough and ready hip-hop, Bon breathe beats and bass. Having now turned their attentions towards making their mark on a vibrant, flourishing and ever-changing new generation of 4x4 sonics, expect big things indeed from a duo that are more than ready to deliver the goods across dancefloors nationwide.",

Seeing as I was so disgusted with the so called \u201cHip-Hop\u201d music that was coming out at the time, I wanted to make my own to try and show the diversity of Hip-Hop and how much deeper it can go in comparison to the superficial surface that many of its critics complain about. \\n\\nMy love for Hip-Hop originally grew rapidly seeing as the topics described in songs were usually so real and relative to life. As a kid, I was always a fan of poetry, so with the conjunction of the complex rhythmical aspects of the music there was an attraction I couldn't stray away from. \\n\\nMy music goes over several topics and usually circulates on my views, opinions and ideas of what I was thinking about at the time. This can range from subject matter about the state of Hip-Hop, life in the UK, to thoughtful passages into the brains workings. I feel this is a clear reflection of Hip-Hop as my summary of the genre would be, \u201cexpression of self\u201d. \\n\\nAfter finishing University and finally having some free time on my hands to fully work on my music, I recently managed to complete my album, Thoughts From The Bedroom. You can download the album for free via one of the links above. The E.P. is also included on the end, which is a small compilation of some of the songs I did when I started out, terrible sound quality remains to create a contrast with the album to try and show my development and evolution in sound recording. \\n\\nI continue to work on newer songs and evolving my style. I am also taking up beat-making to try and expand my horizons and make songs completely my own (rather than just the lyrics).\\n\\nPlease feel free to contact me with any queries or suggestions, whether based on how to improve, what you thought of the music or simply just to ask a random question. I hope you enjoy what you hear.",

I'm in love with sounds, but more importantly, I love to create music from these souns. The possibilities are endless, therefore my main intention is to provide the listener with the perspective that would allow her/him to explore the creative possibilities of sound production. I would assume, that like any other musician, I create from the experiences of the everyday life. From the music's point of view, I am influenced by Electroacoustic Music, Musique Concr\u00e8te, Deutche Elektronische Musik, Glitch, contemporary dance music such as Techno, House, Hip-Hop, Dubstep, Drum and Bass and all the others - too many to mention here. \\nAt the moment I am composing music that I hope will be heard, appreciated or hated, and hopefully released. Although we live in the internet age, it is exceptionally easy for many musicians to be lost in the data jungle and never be heard. I would appreciate any feedback. Lots of love and good luck.

With his mum on guitar and his brother bass, it wasn\u2019t long before this talented pianist found his place. Greatly influenced by his eclectic taste, Dion quickly mastered Gospel, Neo Soul, Soul, Jazz, Funk, Country, Folk, Hip Hop and R\\u0026B. At the age of 14, Dion joined his church band, where drums and bass were soon added to his repertoire of skills.\\n\\nBy the age of 16 he was the musical director of that band, his reign ending in 2012. Passionate about music, after studying Performing Arts and Musical Technology at college, Dion started working in music production at the age of 22, joining a production team called Parker \\u0026 James as their in-house pianist in November 2009. Since then he has collaborated with artists such as Chipmunk, N-Dubz, Angel, Conor Maynard, Kylie Minogue, Rita Ora, K Koke, Giggs, Sneakbo and many more over a 3 year period. In 2012 Dion co produced Angel\u2019s debut album \u2018About Time\u2019 and co-wrote his second single \u2018Wonderful\u2019, which peaked at number nine in the UK charts. He also co produced Conor Maynard\u2019s second single \u2018Vegas Girl\u2019 from his debut album \u2018Contrast\u2019 which peaked at number 4 in the UK Charts and number 1 in the US Billboard charts. \\n\\nIn 2012, Dion went on to strike up a production partnership with Parker Ighile who is currently signed to Nicki Minaj as the first official artist to her label. Since then Dion has co-produced Parker\u2019s first single \u2018So Beautiful\u2019 which was released digitally; and branching into international live performance, Dion had the privilege of working with world-renowned record producer and composer Quincy Jones. Dion co-wrote \u2018Hope You Understand\u2019 on Grace Sewell\u2019s debut album \u2018FMA\u2019 and undertook UK tv and radio tours to promote her first single, \u2018You Don\u2019t Own Me\u2019. More recently, he worked with Fraser T Smith in collaborating with Stormzy on his debut album \u2018Gang Signs and Prayer\u2019, co-writing on \u2018Cigarettes and Cush\u2019 and \u2018Blinded By Your Grace, Pt 1\u2019 and adding production on \u201921 Gun Salute\u2019 and \u2018Blinded By Your Grace, Pt 2\u2019. Dion has also been credited as a co-producer on tracks from artists such as Rebecca Ferguson, Shan Smile, Tamera Foster and Callum Scott, as well as accompanying Sarah Evelyn live with his exemplary piano playing.",

        "description": "After writing songs since he was 5 years old and performing in bands since he was 9, Jared Woods (hatched and grown in Cape Town, South Africa), realised what was wrong. It was the simple essence of bands themselves: a collaborative collection of ideas which ultimately resulted in compromised visions and a cock-measuring competition of egos. It was with this epiphany that the protagonist figured out a new route to fully express his musical passion. Going solo. It was genius, as this approach ensured that the band would never have any reason to break-up, and that he and himself would hardly ever argue about direction. It\u2019s the whole \u201cif you want something done right...\u201d cliche, all over again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo after lengthy conversations in his mind on the cold cobbled streets outside London pubs (where Jared had since relocated to chase the dream), Coming Down Happy was born. But despite the fact that the seed was planted as early as 2008, it took over 4 years for our hero to stop picking his nose and smelling his own farts, eventually finding the strength needed to grant this project its final lift-off, in 2012. The reasons for this delay were many, and not exclusively a result of laziness. No, instead this hindrance was owed above all else, to the approach in which Jared had chosen to release said songs, by creating something much more elaborate than your average musical project.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by a recent lengthy heartbreak he had endured in 2009, the center of Coming Down Happy told the fictional tale of one rockstar named LegoTrip, who meets an evil girl that curses him with her poisonous vagina, causing him to fall deeply and irrationally in love with her. This story was not only communicated via the means of lyrics, but also with the aid of a comicesque-musical, each song supported by hundreds of cartoon images, carefully stitched together in video format, introducing a surreal world of characters and events. The whole concept was to be composed, sung, rapped, screamed, mixed, drawn, video-edited, and web-designed/developed by Jared Woods alone, and all of it available to the masses for free (with a planned comic book in the works, too). The project was so intricate, in fact, that the boy had convinced himself that when the original 4 part EP was released, he would surely be propelled into superstardom.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo such luck, as almost the opposite took place. Due to the careless practice of mentioning real people and situations by name, blurring the line between reality and fiction, the outlet encouraged a vicious backlash to ensue, resulting in hate mail from anonymous listeners as well as his own parents, and even some seriously violent threats to his well-being. But this didn\u2019t bother Jared as much as the lack of fame did, and he fell into a deep depression for months following.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, time has been good to the healing process, and the show must go on. And even in those dark days, Jared never once turned his back on the music, always letting the ideas stew, calculating his next move. A couple of even less successful singles later, and he was ready to continue the story he had started, following the turmoil of LegoTrip once again, observing the fight against misery in The Black EP sequel. This 4-track offering will be released song-by-song sporadically over 2013, in hopes that our cartoon friend may find some peace, and that Jared may find some fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut regardless of outcomes, one thing's for certain: this abrasive, sample-heavy, multi-media, genre-crossing musical approach (standing currently as a hybrid of hip-hop flows, metal screams, horrorcore contexts, dark electropop ideals, scat scoobi-doo-bahs, dubstep drops, trip-hop sleeps, house-music satires, post-punk deliveries, raggamuffin irieness, and drum 'n' bass breaks - to name a few) featuring perverted adults themes (subjects including genitalia, mensturation, ejaculation, devirginizing, Satanism, blasphemy, suicide, abortions and murder) which are unnecessarily offensive without losing a sense of humour and cartoon cheerfulness... will always be completely unsignable, unmarketable or indescribable. But, hey, at least it will give you something to do with your afternoon.",

I started getting into this whole dance music way back in 1989 as one of my cousin's worked for an Acid Rave promotions called Rain Dance, at the time it took me a little while to get use to as i was very much into my Hip-Hop at the time. Anyway to cut a very, very long story short i ended up getting into the whole scene and took a journey to quite a few illegal barn and warehouse rave's. \\r\\n\\r\\n              I've bin mixing now for 19yrs and dj'ing in clubs for around 15yrs, i've played on many pirate radio stations such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n              Influence Fm, which was my first ever station way back in 1991.\\r\\n              Also Lightning Fm, Taste Fm, Freak Fm, 99.3 Fm, World Wide which was an internet based station, Unknown Fm plus a few other stations but i carn't remember thier names (lol)\\r\\n\\r\\n              I've played up and down the country (England) at many clubs and also had quite a few residencies over the years.\\r\\n\\r\\n              I've bin making music myself now for around 10 years but have bin in and out of studio's for  the past 15 years. My studio is called Golden Studio and my production company is called Golden Productions and its taken me a very long time to get it to where it is today, but i LOVE making music and will continue to invest in my sound as I'm not into this \\",

        "description": "I first got into music when i was about 5. When I discovered the Beatles aged 10 is when I first fell in love with music.I collected all their albums on vinyl. It wasn't until I was about 15 or 16 that I listened to anything current. I got very into the baggy indie scene and in particular the Happy Mondays. Aged 18 i went to my first rave at Labrynth in Dalston and was converted to dance music instantly. It was also around this time that I took an interest in hip hop. American groups like Public Enemy and NWA and artists such as 2Pac and Snoop Dogg were my first taste of hip hop aside from the UK's Silver Bullet and Stereo MCs. My record collecting really took off when I started trailing 2nd hand records shops for rare dance records every place I visited. I started mixing when I was 19 and took the name DJ Disturbance. Named after the Hyper-On-Experience track on Moving Shadow in my opinion one of the greatest drum and bass tunes ever made. Always mixing at home and at chill outs and some times out. Before forming DSK Productions with The Wizard and Phil Good when we started putting on our own events. Although still really enjoying mixing breakbeat at home in the first few years of the new millenium i pretty much retired from playing out. My interest in dance music faded as I grew more and more drawn to UK hip hop. In particular Plan B. US hip hop was far detached from the original roots of rhyming on street corners as the charts were dominated by millionare RnB pop stars. UK hip hop was raw, from the streets and talked about the place where i live and the things that effect my life. UK rappers like Skinnyman, Klashnekoff, Chester P, Braintax, Rodney P, Dr Syntax and Jehst confirmed to me that UK hip hop was were my heart lies. Although I had the desire to write lyrics all along I never picked up a pen until 2010/11. I started with the intention of writing songs but was appoached by DJ Narky and asked to MC while he mixed breaks. This form of lyric writing was a lot easier than writing songs cos as long as you kept the crowd motivated the lyrics didn't need to be complex. In the first few months of 2014 after an extended period of writers block I started writing whole songs again. By the end of Feb I had 5 completed songs that were to a high enough standard, with good length, intellegent lyrical content, a strong storyline and message that I felt it was time to share. I feel I still I have a lot to learn and I am improving every time i write. So, onwards and upwards. I haven't written my masterpiece yet, so watch this space...",

        "description": "Reverie-Soul Biog/ The Forming of RMG\\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher Pottinger was born on 30th October 1985 in Edmonton, North London. He was the youngest of four children born to Dennis Pottinger, a litigation clerk from Kingston, Jamaica and English mother, Diana Pottinger (nee Cooper), a full time mother and former primary school teacher. \\r\\n\\r\\nMusic had always run in the family. His second cousin Caron Wheeler was the lead vocalist of the Grammy award winning British Soul Group, Soul II Soul who had the smash hits, \u2018Back to Life\u2019 and \u2018Keep on Movin\u2019. Also his maternal grandfather was a professional bassoonist for the BBC orchestra for The Beatles and Supergirl film score to mention a few.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaised in North London, Christopher\u2019s mother says Christopher had an almost worrying attachment towards his father\u2019s \u2018Motown 25\u2019 video and record collection, which began from as early as two years old. To this day Christopher cites 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s Soul artists such as Prince, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Leon Ware and Michael Jackson to be his greatest musical influences. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was ten he started keyboard lessons, where he learned to sequence a track and pretty soon he was creating whole songs on his own. At the age of fifteen, Christopher took a work experience placement at darkerthanblue.com, a black music website, where he met a number of Hip-Hop artists, including Brova Ben, Mystro (lowlife) and Fusion, who he later went on to co-produce a track called \u2018Be Bad Feel Good\u2019 for UK Rap Artist Fallacy\u2019s 2003 album \u2018Blackmarket Boy\u2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt age eighteen Christopher had set up his own home recording studio and began producing tracks at an unstoppable rate. In November 2005 Christopher enjoyed his first radio play, Trevor Nelson gave \u20182 Much 2 Lose 4 U\u2019 a spin on his show and it was clear there was potential for something magical to happen. In 2008 Jenny Francis, of Choice FM started to regularly play a self produced track called \u2018Don\u2019t Break\u2019; a track where Reverie\u2019s alter ego \u2018God Knows\u2019 tells the true story of the break up with his first love.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years Christopher has focused on turning his talents and passions: rapping singing and producing into skills. Reverie sees himself following in the footsteps of artists such as Stevie Wonder, Prince having a wide musical reach yet rooted in Urban / Soul music; more recent examples would be: Andre 3000, Cee-Lo / Gnarls Barkley \\u0026 Pharel. \\r\\n\\r\\nChristopher was baptized in July 2006 at Edmonton New Testament Church of God. He says this was God\u2019s stamp of approval on the immense career that he is determined to have. He is constantly in his studio recording material, with songs pilling up in excess of over 500. \\r\\n\\r\\nReverie-Soul is currently focused on a batch of 60 songs which fall into what will be his first 3 albums, as well as writing and producing tracks with Lero Browne (formerly Plague A\u2019Lero of Payasyougo) as well as fresh artists Carla Foster and Andre Rose who are part of the independent label Reverie Music Group, that vows to bring back the love into music from an untarnished \u2018love of music perspective\u2019.  Also in the Reverie Music Group roster are budding producers Digital Drum who contributes a stunning R\\u0026B/Rap Remix to RMG\u2019s first official E.P headline track \u201cRain\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cRain\u201d is a prime example of what RMG represents as it has uplifting lyrics placed over a Soul-rooted, cutting edge House/funky/techno style beat which has been rated by DJ Footlose as No.2 in his top ten \u2018big new tracks\u2019 list. Now the track is updated and backed up by a music video filmed at Luke Biggins\u2019 new film studio and directed by BBC 6\u2019s Iyare Igiehon, \u201cRain\u201d and RMG are ready to start unleashing the wealth of music they have. Also on the EP is the long awaited release of Don\u2019t Break \u2013 God Knows and a brand new track from RMG artist Andre Rose. Available on itunes only, The Reverie Music Group EP Vol.1, is merely a taster of what is to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingers, musicians, visionaries, a movement; Reverie Music Group is here. \\r\\n",

With their second album in the pipeline whilst preparing the onslaughtof Peace by Piece on the general public, the band have created a full-onlive experience to showcase their talents, having initially broken outat a prime slot at the Chingford Festival to a sell-out crowd. Lead vocals come from the sublime Paula Mount, and East London urban MCextraordinaire, Mykey Supa. With years of frontline experience spanningthroughout the band, bassist/vocalist Simon Laffy, drummer Andy Booker,Guitarist/keyboards Jake Cusack and synths from Nick Pratt complete thefully rounded sound that includes elements of old school hip hop,up-front drum and bass and more commercial soothing tones. One aspect ofthe Skylinerz sound that cannot be doubted is the austere precision thatemanates from their production and they appear to have duplicated thiswith the animation/graphic talent that encapsulates their music.

With James being mostly outright Indie (The Steers \\u0026 The Lightwings) and Steffen being more at home with Hip Hop, Soul and Funk (Gizelle Smith, Mocambo Records and various German Hip Hop artists) the combined song-writing efforts make up for an interesting blend of PSYCHEDELIC, FUNK and SOUL.\\n\\nAfter a few jamming sessions the duo were armed with enough tunes to take to Hamburg for a long weekend to lay down the rhythm tracks. This was done nowhere less than at MOCAMBO RECORDS\u2019 own 8-track tape studio. The vocals and horns were then recorded back in London.\\n\\nStef\u2019s production provides the tracks with a distinct element of a gritty analogue sound, most noticeable in the 60s drum sound, whilst James' vocals drive the matter gently back towards ALTERNATIVE/INDIE. Interesting song arrangements full of clever interceptions keep the songs from ever being predictable and add to how this all quite naturally blends into something that could be best described as PSYCHEDELIC ROCK AND SOUL.",

His rhythm and delivery is consistent and convincing, and he understands the need for hooks and what I call \u2018pop sensibility.\u2019 His use of chorus is commercial without being crass, and there is a musicality about his compositions that I am impressed with. There is a depth to what he is doing that I like\u201d Alan Moulder (Record Producer)\\n\\nWhen looking at a painting we identify, among other things, both the beauty and darkness of the composition. We try to understand the artist through the various shades and colors, and although not a painter, Ray\u2019s colors are so bold and his shades so dark that we are under no illusion as to what he feels. A poet who paints his pictures with words, Ray bares his soul and invites his listener to view the world from a fresh perspective; a perspective that manages to be both intensely individual, yet globally applicable. \\n\\nA classically trained pianist, songwriter and artist, Ray graduated from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts with a BA (Hons) in Sound Technology. During his time at LIPA, Ray performed on a track that won First Place for most downloaded song in a competition hosted by EMI Japan \\u0026 the British Council. Subsequently, Ray won First Place for the R\\u0026B/Hip-Hop category of the International Songwriting Competition. Judges included Timbaland \\u0026 Darryl McDaniels of Run DMC. Following this win, Ray won Grand Prize as well as the Lennon Award for the Hip-Hop category of the John Lennon Song writing Contest. His highest accolade came when the Rebel With A Cause EP garnered positive reviews from British alternative rock record producer Alan Moulder. Ray\u2019s Requiem For Hip Hop EP was released in 2012. His latest single, Rock-A-Bye, is due for release this spring, accompanied by a music video with director Andy Marsh at the helm (Keane, Black Rain).    ",

He started his own career being a \u201cpeople\u2019s DJ\u201d in Reading, and travelling around the Midlands, playing at universities, house parties, and wine bars. Forever wanting to be a crowd pleaser, he always gives 150% in his performances spreading a \u201cfeel-good\u201d vibe to all audiences. Gaining a strong influence in all genres of music (but specialising in New Jack Swing, RnB , Reggae and Hip-Hop), DJ L.P shows confidence in any form of music he is asked to play.\\r\\n\\r\\nDJ L.P was brought up on the original Motown Classics, listening to the likes of Marvin Gaye, Chaka Khan, Luther Vandross, etc. From an early age he was shown the value of true soul music as his father was a guitarists for soul bands in the 1970\u2019s.\\r\\nAt a young age he took an even closer interest by learning to play the violin, piano and drums. All of this led on to his understanding of notes, music scoring and beat matching.\\r\\nHis love of music lead him to study the whole scene rather than taking it at \u2018face value\u2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until college where older piers influenced DJ L.P. in to building his record collection even more, and his die hard thirst for urban music became apparent. An older pier at college was also his tutor for DJing, and once he got the bug \u2026.. he never stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom college parties, to clubs around the country \u2026.. DJ L.P feels most at home with a \u2018personal feel\u2019 to any type of party. The original house party rocker, he keeps that vibe with him wherever he goes. Taking styles and learning all the time, it is an education for him whenever he goes to a new club or area. Now as eclectic as his music tastes have become, in the past few years DJ L.P. has ventured in to different areas. Not just considered as one of the best urban music DJs, DJ L.P. now has a following with his house sets, and has worked for many corporate companies and venues mixing up a treat of all genres from pop to dance classics.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years DJ L.P. has had the privilege to work alongside some of the top DJs around the world, such as London Street Sounds: Da Ill Kidz, Gal Flex and PC Mistry; to world renowned DJs such as DJ Swing, Firin\u2019 Squad, Tim Westwood and David Rodigan\\r\\n\\r\\nDJ L.P. has a style that many try to imitate. Behind the decks he is at home, and his energy is electrifying to anyone who has had the pleasure to experience it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClubs Played:\\r\\nReading: Face Club, Bar Oz, Colorz Venue, Bamboo, The Forum, Bar 4, The Arches, Jazz Club, The Venue, Caf\u00e9 Du Sport, Club Mango\\r\\nReading Community Carnival\\r\\n\\r\\nBracknell: Shikara Nightclub, Taboo Nightclub, The Drum\\r\\n\\r\\nNewbury \\u0026 Wokingham: The Buzz / Spin Nightclub\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon: Shannons, Zone Nite Club, Industry, Ministry of Sound, The Watershed, Southwark Rooms, Butterfly Bar, Kelko Bar \\u0026 Lounge, Metra Bar \\u0026 Club, Play Bar, So.UK\\r\\n\\r\\nWorthing: The Rest\\r\\n\\r\\nPortsmouth: Scandals, Bar Risa, Bar Bluu, V Bar\\r\\n\\r\\nBasingstoke: Liquid \\u0026 Envy\\r\\n\\r\\nBournemouth: The Lounge\\r\\n\\r\\nHenley-on-Thames: Diamonds \\u0026 Pearls Nightclub\\r\\n\\r\\nGlasgow: Humming Bird, Lebowskis, Ivory Black\\r\\n\\r\\nPortsmouth / Reading / Kingston / Brunel Universities\\r\\n+ many more venues around Southern England\\r\\n\\r\\nRadio Shows:\\r\\nJuice FM (London)\\r\\nY2K (London)\\r\\nPure FM (Portsmouth)\\r\\nUnity Live Radio (Reading)\\r\\nReading4U (Reading)\\r\\n\\r\\nMotto: ALWAYS SPREAD LOVE",

We didn't come back to the UK until we were 13, but while in Grenada We grew up naturally talented in music, performing arts, poetry, media and entertainment. Learning from and listening to all genres of the culture available to us including classical, jazz, blues, funk, latin, rock, live, calypso, reggae, dancehall, hip hop and r 'n' b.\\n\\nAt first we started out as seperate artists from the late '80s to the early 2t. Leon was in a few groups in the r 'n' b genre with band names such as Boys of Harmony From Grenada in the early '90s and as a solo artist named Leon. He performed in shows like Nubian Spotlight in North West London in 96. Snow Ice was in athletics and in a few groups in the hip hop genre with band names like Drastic Mic Lords from Grenada in the early '90s and Creator Stealth until early in the 21st Century. We have both worked in American with music agents in Queens Jamaica NY. We also performed in the venue Soul Caf\u00e9 in Harlem, Manhattan under the name Double Impact in the summer of 2004.\\n\\nAfter countless projects in Grenada, the UK and the USA as well as rehearsing, recording and performing songs with other acts some things did not work out. Eventually the boys together formed a new thing merging a unique blend of 2 of their talents - hip hop and r 'n' b. They used their experiences and strengths in the music industry to create the group named H.T.R, (which stands for High Twins Royalty) in 2007..... and still making brilliant music in 2017.",

With time, they built a small home studio from scratch, with basic equipment that provided a base for their phenomenal rap skills, building a foundation. Later in their teens, they formed the Rap Duo Four4s releasing their 2011 First EP Rap Chambers; 8 tracks of tradition hard-core, boom-bap hip-hop sounds from influences of American Legends such as Wu-tang, KRS1, Big Pun, Big L and many more that had inspired them to experiment with their rhyming skills and beat making techniques. \\nWith all their gains of musical knowledge from rhyming skills, beats production from the core roots of hip hop as well as music promotion and music management, they have now released their long awaited album, 4th Kind. The two put together the whole project; Abstrax the studio man had produced every beat and engineered all 17 songs. Timi RS used his graphics background to create all the imagery and art work for the album. \\n\u201cOne mic, two guys, third eye, fourth kind\u201d Four4s\u2026\\nSwarvemen.com \u2013 \u201cMost artists with a computer won\u2019t necessarily use it to its full potential but on hearing Four4s \u201cThe 4th Kind\u201d album, it\u2019s clear to see this group isn\u2019t one of those artists. Their capacity for creativity isn\u2019t at all limited\u201d.\\n\u201cAmbition, conflict, love, struggle, freedom, politics, art \\u0026 the list goes on. The album itself plays out like an ethereal short-film with eerie synths, witty metaphors and an overbearing message of positivity. You\u2019d need to listen to the album a few times over to really understand what Four4s are really saying.\u201d\\n\\n",

Rapping over Instrumentals and looping up breaks off Gangstarr interludes from the Step in the arena album via pause tape mixing. Lyrics were written, freestyles were born and live performances ensued and that was the foundation that helped shape Maintain to become what he is now. Influences range from Gangstarr, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane, Master Ase, Dela Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, EPMD, Souls Of Mischief, Ice Cube (Amerikkkas most wanted \\u0026 Death Certificate), Diamond D, Nas, Main Source, Soul 2 Soul, London Posse, Caveman, Demon Boys, MC D, DITC, Brand Nubian, 3rd Base etc. Listening to music of that quality I believe has influenced my sound I try to use creative samples heavy basslines and hard drums to get the sound I want! \\n\\nThe Dj\u2019ing began when I used to sneak on to my older brothers Technic 1210\u2019s when he was at work a risk worth taking. Being a Hip Hop fan I always aspired to be a scratch Dj as I feel it separates you from the norm and adds a unique sound to your sets. Influenced by the likes of Jazzy Jeff, Cash Money, Dj Scratch, QBert, Dj Craze, Dj Premier, Cutmaster swift, Karizma. A big influence was watching Trevor Nelson at YO YO\u2019s Oxford Circus. Wasn\u2019t even old enough to be clubbing but I somehow got in and watched him (in a trance) play to and for the crowd and it made me want to do the same.",

During downtime, he teamed up with Daniel Goganian to experiment with the various analog synths and samplers at their disposal; this slowly grew in to an act they named Children of the Bong. \\r\\nCOTB\u2019s reputation grew through infectious live performances and were signed by Planet Dog Records in 1994. The album \u2018Sirius Sounds\u2019 was released in 1995 to critical acclaim and rose to number 3 in the NME\u2019s Indie chart. \u2018The album was an immediate success, selling well both in the UK and the US where it was actually banned by the Wal Mart chain because of the band's name! The music struck a chord in the nascent 'big beat' scene appealing to a younger post-rave audience who were seeking something beyond straight 'four to the floor' dance music, but with a psychedelic and non-formulaic edge\u2019. The strain of constant touring and recording together had taken it\u2019s toll and after completing an albums worth of music for the production company who created C4\u2019s \u2018The Word\u2019, they parted company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next collaboration was with Nick Trimm, the graffiti artist turned DJ who accompanied COTB whenever they played live. They formed Euphonic and released their debut ep and album on the Different Drummer label. The music is a collaborative affair with various like minded suspects drawn in part from Rob and Nick's friends from the Brooklyn hip hop underground including Dr Israel, Soothsayer, and Trymystic Sound System. Other contributors include vocalists Hedlam and Jennifer Achono (Neech). The release attracted some rave reviews, DJ Magazine claiming that listening to it would \u2018make your life better\u2019 9/10.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was during this period that Raymond Watts, aka PIG, hired Rob\u2019s talents to remix and produce a couple of tracks for his next release and was asked to collaborate on SOW\u2019s 2nd release \u2018Sick\u2019. Rob continued to work with Anna Wildsmith (SOW) which took shape as the album \u2018Dog\u2019 in which he wrote and produced 5 tracks.\\r\\n\\r\\nRob\u2019s recent offerings are the output of a long time collaboration with Tony Messenger (The Unlimited Dream Company). Deep City was formed from a mutual love of Funk Electro and House and has started to release some club friendly anthems with great support from top DJ\u2019s such as Russell Small (Freemasons) and Axwell. Dirty Electro, as the name suggests, deals with a no holds barred sonic assault that reflects the pair\u2019s love of big synths and effects!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are interested in working with Rob, please feel free to contact him via this Soundcloud page.\\r\\n",

        "description": "For some, music is entertainment. For others, it is self-expression. This is definitely the way of the Stash Sounds Project, led by talented rapper D.R.E.W. (Dope Rhymes Echo Worldwide).\\n\\nEver since the early 80s, D.R.E.W. has been a huge fan of hip hop, its creative vision and untamable energy. It did not take long before he would fully immerse himself into the local hip hop culture and beyond. Eventually, he started out rapping the year the English Pound Note ceased to be legal tender, 1988, and debuted with a brand new track in 1990, produced by Mac McRaw and recorded at Monroe Studios in Islington, London.\\n\\nD.R.E.W. later performed with rap group \u201c35 Above\u201d, garnering attention and respect throughout the UK\u2019s underground hip hop movement and even performing some of the most notable venues in London, from Subterranea, to Bloomsbury Theatre and The Fridge (now Electric Brixton), just to mention a few. The group\u2019s success extended outside the national boarders, as they managed to appear on various international radio and TV media, as well as stretching their reach overseas with a stunning performance at the legendary Apollo Theatre in NYC.\\n\\nNowadays, D.R.E.W. is pursuing his solo project and his vision is simple: making pure, unadulterated hip hop with a classic tone\u2026and a lot to say!",

        "description": "Jason O\u2019Bryan has been through many twists and turns over the last 25 years, his former band the 'Dub Pistols' now headline sell-out shows and festivals across the world. \\n\\nBy the mid-90s the London based DJ was producing records under the \u2018Ceasefire\u2019 moniker on the legendary Wall of Sound label (including the classic \u2018Trickshot\u2019 feat. Al Pacino), releasing albums on Belgium\u2019s world famous techno label R\\u0026S Records with partner Meat Katie as \u2018Avenue A\u2019 alongside Joey Beltram, Jaydee, C.J Bolland \\u0026 Aphex Twin, and had co-founded the infamous Dub Pistols with DJ Barry Ashworth.\\n\\nThe Dub Pistols initial \u2018Point Blank\u2019 album surfed the late '90s big beat wave with tracks like 'Cyclone', 'Westway' and 'There's Gonna Be A Riot' championed by the likes of Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, Afrika Bambaata and the Chemical Brothers. \\n\\nThe bands second album \u2018Six Million Ways To Live\u2019, signed to major US label Geffen, featured guest vocals by Terry Hall from The Specials, Planet Asia and long term Massive Attack vocalist Horace Andy, the album\u2019s success led to Jason O\u2019Bryan being the producer and remixer of choice for many popular artists including Moby, Limp Bizkit, Ian Brown, Bush, Korn, Natalie Imbruglia, Bono (U2), Lily Allen, Rob Zombie, Scissor Sisters, Audioweb, Arkarna, Banco de Gaia, Bow Wow Wow, The Crystal Method, Scapegoat Wax, Sly \\u0026 Robbie, The Freestylers, Apollo 440, Mantronix, Hurricane No.1, Collapsed Lung, Dee Patten, So Solid Crew and Roots Manuva.\\n\\nThe third album \u2018Speakers \\u0026 Tweeters\u2019 album released on Sunday Best saw further collaborations with Terry Hall on a number of tracks. Hall is on record as saying that singing with the Dubs \u2013 and realizing how much love was out there for his former 2-Tone band \u2013 was instrumental in one of the biggest reunions of recent times (The Specials). Indeed, having also played live with the Dub Pistols a few times, guitarist Lynval Golding personally asked the Dub Pistols to support The Specials on their first comeback tour. The \u2018Speakers \\u0026 Tweeters\u2019 album also began a long-term association with UK hip-hop originator Rodney P, which continues to this day.\\n\\nRecorded in Barbados, the band\u2019s fourth album \u2018Rum \\u0026 Coke\u2019 was a body of work hailed by fans and critics alike. As well as the usual regulars, the album also featured Lindy Layton (formerly in Norman Cook\u2019s Beats International project), DJ Justin Robertson (Lionrock/Deadstock 33s) and celebrated trombone player Ashley Slater (also in a band with Norman Cook (Freakpower), whose single \u2018Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out\u2019 single topped the UK charts in the mid-90s).\\n\\nJason O\u2019Bryan\u2019s music has often featured in movie soundtracks most notably \u2018Keep Movin\u2019 that was used as the trailer music for the first Austin Powers film. The song was also featured in the Ben Stiller Movie \u2018Mystery Men\u2019; O\u2019Bryan\u2019s music was once again personally chosen by Stiller and featured heavily in the motion picture \u2018Zoolander\u2019 also co-starring Owen Wilson. Jason also worked in Mexico City alongside Oscar winning director Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity) and the cult band \u2018Molotov\u2019 to create original music for Cuaron\u2019s classic \u2018Y Tu Mama Tambien\u2019. O\u2019Bryan was also commissioned to write original music for the \u2018Blade 2\u2019 soundtrack with the legendary rapper Busta Rhymes, which paired UK electronic artists with heavyweight US rappers.\\n\\n\u2018Six Million Ways to Live\u2019 a song co-written by O\u2019Bryan was used as the end title music in the Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins movie \u2018Bad Company\u2019 and Dub Pistols song \u2018Official Chemical\u2019 was used in the Joel Schumacher movie \u2018Driven\u2019 featuring Sylvester Stallone. The US series \u2018Bullrun\u2019 also features Jason\u2019s music as the program\u2019s theme music as well as incidental music throughout the series; his work continues to be licensed to major Motion pictures and TV series.\\n\\nMany songs Jason O\u2019Bryan has composed have also been featured in best selling video games including Frequency, Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Final Fight streetwise, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 09 and EA Sports' FIFA 99.\\n\\nJason O\u2019Bryan has programmed numerous DJ Mixes for Radio Shows including Kiss FM (U.K) and Radio One (U.K) and many DJ\u2019s have favored Jason\u2019s productions including the most highly respected in a variety of musical circles such as The Chemical Brothers, Afrika Bambaata, Howie B, Giles Peterson, Paul Oakenfold and Coldcut. O\u2019Bryan has performed at countless major events and clubs including The Glastonbury Festival (UK), Reading Festival (UK), Solidays (Paris), V Festival, Creamfields (Argentina), Rockness (UK) and the Vans Warped Tour (USA).\\n\\nFrom the early beginnings as a sound-system project, the Dub Pistols grew into a party-rocking live act that never failed to ignite a festival or venue. In December 2011 the Dub Pistols were named the \u2018Best Live Band 2011\u2019 in DJ Magazine\u2019s annual Best of British Awards \u2013 a fitting accolade, the band celebrated whilst playing to over 100,000 people at an event broadcast live to a TV audience of over 2 million people. Dub Pistols were also voted \u2018Best Live Act 2013\u2019 at the Breakspoll awards.\\n\\nJason, who currently resides in Jakarta, Indonesia, DJ\u2019s in various styles across musical genres from peak hour Club sets to laidback down tempo Reggae and Hip Hop. His DJ sets are an infectious blend that has won him many fans around the globe over the last 15 years.\\n",

By the age of 16, he got a set of turntables and began DJing for school parties and private functions in his home town. House and Acid House was the first music genre that caught his attention and captivated him. MISTER H's main influence is the world famous DJ and Techno/House pioneer, DJ Carl Cox.

        "description": "DJ Reese is a 27 year old DJ, producer and audio engineer based in London, Ontario. Since he was a young child, Reese had a love and passion for music that has only intensified. His first exposure to music was to a myriad of different genres ranging from 90's Alternative to Hip-Hop by way of outlets such as local radio stations and Much Music. Right around the time Cash Money, Ruff Ryders, Eminem, Dr. Dre, Ludacris, and Limp Bizkit were at the height of their popularity, that's when his love for Hip-Hop began to develop and he knew he wanted to be involved with it somehow. His father introduced him to the classics and legends of Hip-Hop including artists like Cyprus Hill, the Beastie Boys, and even some early dance music by artists like The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal Method, and Moby.\u201d \\nA few years later around 2001 Reese\u2019s uncle - a guitarist and rapper, introduced him to his Numark turntables and drum machine for the first time and Reese says he knew from that day, music was in his blood. Reese and his uncle started to hang out frequently and recorded songs almost every weekend. From that point on, the passion he felt brewing then has only gotten stronger. Reese eventually put together his own studio set up and began making mix tapes, taking cues from then popular artists such as groups Dipset, State Property, G Unit and D Block. He would often come home from school and record his own Rap City freestyles to cassette tapes. \\nIn 2006, Reese got in touch with a Justo Award mixtape DJ in Toronto named DJ Rated R. This DJ mentored him and helped Reese make his name in the mixtape world. For many years he took to putting out tons of CDs with DJs that he looked up to who were mostly from the NYC and Philly area. He recalls it as a \u201ccrazy experience\u201d and to this day, he\u2019s still strongly focused on becoming better and honing his craft. Last year in November, he got the worst phone call he could ever imagine. Reese had found out that his uncle had passed away. After that, not only was he driven, he became even more dedicated to his music in honor of his late uncle - \u201call he ever wanted was to see me succeed.\u201d This year DJ Reese has been focusing on production and turntablism and getting his name known, not only for himself but for his family, friends and the people who have supported him since day one.",

        "description": "\\t\\r\\nIn November 2004 I was in a group formed called WSO, the initials stood for We Stand Out which explains everything you need to know about us. I started on a music course and was taught how to create songs at a professional standard and gained sound engineering qualifications. We made our first release; Straight Loving, an underground slow jam. In February 05 we came across Live Recordings which opened the door for us. We then had an official single released. The single was called Da Game which had a remix by the left field hip-hop collective called the Reptiles. I then went on to release another underground song called I Think About You.In 2007 WSO was no longer a collective and I went on as a solo artist. Since then life has had many ups and downs but now I am here to tell my story to you guys. Most importantly I want you all to enjoy the stories and possibly learn from me. Peace.",

He has studied with Joe Csibi (principal trumpet in the Irish National Symphony Orchestra) and Bobby Shew (Buddy Rich, Horace Silver bands) as well as learning harmony from Trevor England (ex-Berklee). As a bass he was a Vocal Scholar of the College of Music and a Choral Scholar of Christchurch Cathedral, Dublin. There is a strong tradition of trumpet playing in Smith's family, his grandfather Chick Smith played in many British dance bands from the 1930s onwards and his cousin Jimmie Deuchar was at the forefront of British bop as well as playing in the Clarke/Boland Big Band.\\nDuring the mid-80s while in Trinity College, Dublin, he arranged music for and played on many recording sessions, including jingles for the Bank of Ireland, a TV documentary score and singles for local rock bands. He has also composed and performed for theatrical productions including a version of Joyce's Nighttown scene from Ulysses at the Project theatre, Dublin. \\nHe has guested on albums by highly established Irish songwriters like Luka Bloom and Mick Hanley. He joined post-punk band the Real Wild West in the late 80s and gigged frequently with them for three years, including playing the Eurorock Festival '87 in Frankfurt, the Mean Fiddler in London and supporting Echo and the Bunnymen and the Pogues in Ireland. The Real Wild West single was produced by Pogues Shane MacGowan and Philip Chevron; the album was produced by John Langford of The Mekons. \\nIan Smith appeared at the Cork International Jazz Festival in 1988 and 1989, playing a set with saxophonist Richie Cole in '89. He has been involved in duo and trio gigs with guitarist Louis Stewart. He moved over to London in 1990 and in May '91 co-founded the group Forest which quickly became established on the London freeform scene. He was a sometime member of the Screech Owls, a rock band which featured former Virgin Prune Dik Evans, which performed at the Mean Fiddler. \\nSince 1992 he has been playing improvised music and has performed with Evan Parker, John Stevens, Maggie Nicols, Lol Coxhill, Steve Beresford and Eddie Pr\u00e9vost among others. His own trio, Trian, has played at the 1993 London Experimental Music Festival and the 1992 Soho Jazz Festival. He also participated in a reformation of Cornelius Cardew's Scratch Orchestra in the ICA in 1994. He has collaborated with composer Roger Doyle, winner of the Bourges International Elecro-Acoustic Music Competition 1997, and he has been featured on two instrumental tracks by the hip hop band Marxman. He toured the UK with Butch Morris' London Skyscraper conduction project in November 1997.He helped to institute the London Improvisers orchestra in 1998 with Steve Beresford and Evan Parker, which continues to play monthly in London and has recently performed at the Bimhuis in Amsterdam. He also founded The Gathering with Maggie Nichols.\\n\\nIn 2000 he recorded his second CD as a leader, Daybreak, with Derek Bailey, Veryan Weston, Gail Brand and Oren Marshall. Into the twenty-first century, as well as regularly playing with London improvisers, he has also performed with Greg Tate\u2019s Burnt Sugar Arkestra, guitarists Han-earl Park, Reeves Gabrels, the Poet and Detriot legend John Sinclair, and New York based drummer Harris Eisenstadt.\\n",

Later on, influence from American Hip Hop Classics and New Jack Swing of the 90\u2019s led him to begin Break Dance. From then on, He has been around Japan to perform in events and clubs, on stage and TV, producing music free of any specific genre and have been receiving great support. On the other hand, he has also been doing work as a DJ as well as a track producer, producing all the performance music for these. During the late 90\u2019s to 2004, he received great influence from the growing party movement which led to his great interest in rave culture. Starting in 2002, he started traveling all over the world for almost 3 years, going around over 20 countries. During this period, he was able to experience various outdoor festivals as well as having chances to organize parties in Britain (London), India (Goa) and Japan (Tokyo). Currently he is concentrating on creating music basing himself in Britain (London).",

Mixed in this blend was the British Rock band Queen where You Love House first experienced musical instruments being played together.\\n\\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 90\u2019s that Julian really had a taste for the UK music scene. A fine collector of the Jungle Hits series, where Ragga met Drum n\u2019 Bass, saw an early era of blank TDK 60 minute cassette tapes which Julian would use to record off the radio, coupled with official cassette tapes borrowed from the local libraries.\\n\\nStill very much US Hip-Hop inspired, Busta Rhymes was a mainstay in Julian\u2019s music collection, accompanied later by West Coast\u2019s Death Row and East Coast\u2019s Bad Boy driven records.\\n\\nGrowing up in Finsbury Park, North London, Julian was exposed to the UK Garage music scene, where household favourites Heartless Crew were regulars on the North London radio airwaves (Freak FM). This is where raving began for Julian. Whereas a 16 year old in the year 2000 nightclubs Bagley\u2019s Kings Cross, Kentish Town Forum, and Palace Pavilion Hackney were regularly visited.\\n\\nNow as a 17 year old in 2001, attending college in East London, Julian witnessed the birth of Grime. Listening to early Grime favourites such as Nasty Crew and Wiley\u2019s driven Roll Deep Crew on the East London pirate radio stations, and watching everyone around him strive to be the next Grime star, Julian\u2019s interest in music production started. An install of Fruity Loops on his windows laptop helped Julian to understand the basics of music composition.\\n\\nThis variety of music genres helped Julian to build a versatile and dynamic music library. Filled mostly with production from The Neptunes, UK Garage pioneer Wookie, 9th Wonder, UK outfit Jamiroquai, J Dilla, Grime pioneer Wiley, West Coast Hip Hop\u2019s Dr Dre, and East coast raps DJ Premier. \\n\\nIt wasn\u2019t until much later, where a birthday inspired visit to Ibiza opened up Julian\u2019s ears to EDM; in particular Deep House. This coupled with experiencing day parties such as London\u2019s Secretsundaze, Barcelona\u2019s annual Sonar music festival, and Ibiza\u2019s airport jungle DC10, a love for entertaining was born.\\n\\nJulian\u2019s music collection now features the likes of Patrick Topping, Alexis Raphael, wAFF, and Kerri Chandler. Crowd entertainment is his one and only goal, delivering a musical experience to wow his listener each and every time.",

From the hustle of East London to the streets of Gambia, he has achieved with his music things he never thought possible.\\n\\n\u201cAs I teenager, I never believed my music would go further than the four walls of my room. I only ever wanted to get my thoughts and feelings out there for people to hear and hopefully understand. When people reach out to me from my own ends to as far as New York or even Thailand, I feel humbled, and ready to push for new goals.\u201d\\n\\nCyclonious the Natural Disaster has been achieving goals through hip-hop from as young as 11-years-old. He began writing bars, which he refers to as \u201cany play school jams\u201d, but those early stages of pen to paper were the roots of deeper, more personal material based on the reality he knew. Artists such as KRS-1, Wu-Tang and at the top of that list, Tupac, were influential.\\n\\nTheir fearless style helped him cultivate his own sound which is evident in his music with tracks like Never Lose Your Passion which challenges the listener to find strength in their weakness, and Don\u2019t Sleep asking us to wake up to the atrocities that happen worldwide to our own doorstep.\\n\\nFast forward to the present day and years spent producing, writing and working with varied artists has led Cyclonius The Natural Disaster to be the artist we all know, love and respect. He doesn\u2019t hesitate to speak his mind on whatever subject, bringing his vision to concepts based on his background, love for his culture and using the power of words and rhythm combined.\\n",

With the love for Jazz, hip hop and soul her voice moves along those style in a very sassy way.  Valentina found herself fully blended with DOTS as this project is what she was waitng for. Valentina is also featuring in Cesare Vs Disorder coming album and collaborating with Italians Dj/producers as ASAL and Fideles for further releases.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe project started in London with Valentina bringing her soul jazz fused influence to Aurelien\u2019s underground electronic defined sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nD.O.T.S. formed with a purpose of fusion, sharing skills to create spontaneous compositions the project is based on a meltingpot of many influences, among them downtempo and jazz infused electronica. Whilst producing a unique sound the pair really felt strongly and passionately about what they were creating together and decided to take a steps futher and expanding the project and involving more musicians, including a bass player, drummer, keyboard player and trumpet.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole idea of D.O.T.S. is to involve all these musicians who are from different scenes and genres to collaborate freely into a music interaction within the compositions. D.O.TS. wants to leave the role of leadership to everybody and give the artist and musicians involved the chance to express their feelings towards the sound previously created in Aurelien studio. Over Valentina\u2019s melodic lines and lyrics, Aurelien\u2019s experimental recordings the whole frame of music will then come from a spontaneous instrumental composition which it will then be stripped down into a real arrangement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe addition and role of Derby\u2019s Andy K Allen is of arranger and he is also  the trumpet player in D.O.T.S. Hailing from Derby, Andy began playing the trumpet at the age of 9 and has gigged extensively with various bands around the world, playing in London, New York, LA, Toronto, Paris, Brussels and Tokyo.

        "description": "11ven\\n\\nBorn in the eleventh month, on the eleventh day, at the eleventh hour, it\u2019s no wonder that for singer-songwriter 11ven this number is her lucky charm. \u201cWith me, everything happens in elevens.\u201d\\n\\n\\nAfter years working on musical projects with big backing but little soul, it was a chance meeting with the booker for London\u2019s celebrated Cirque Le Soir that changed her life\u2019s course. \u201cJoining the circus let me find out who I am.\u201d It soon became her second home. It was there that she learned to dance and sing with fire, as well as fan dancing, swinging from the ceiling on aerial hoops and putting on a burlesque show. \u201cHaving always been a performance artist as well as a musician, I was able to merge the two. I put a huge stage show together that was both visually and musically appealing.\u201d\\n\\n\\nHaving accumulated a wealth of once in a lifetime experiences, armed with extraordinary skills and a love of performing, a return to the pop music world was only a matter of time. 11ven hit the studio with Steve Lewinson (Amy Winehouse, Sade) who quickly tapped into her cinematic artistry and worked with her in telling her story. With her parents divorcing when she was 6 months old 11ven recounts that there were always sad love songs playing at home. \u201cI pretty much sing about tragedy in my life. But I quite like that \u2013 it makes me happy.\u201d\\n\\n\\nMusically influenced by blues, jazz and hip hop, 11ven describes her signature sound as pop with a moody and dark twist. Having been given impersonal pop songs to sing in her previous musical incarnations the key to project 11ven is it\u2019s overwhelming authenticity, pervading through her overall creative direction \u2013 a combination of old-world glamour and tribal aesthetic. \u201cI wear my jewellery like it\u2019s my clothes\u201d.\\n\\n\\nBlog favourites Eddy Atlantis and Lex Low also joined the project, leading to \u2018Eros\u2019, the soon to be released EP. \u2018Been Around The World\u2019, the first single from the record, is a new spin on Lisa Stanfield\u2019s 80s classic \u2018All Around The World\u2019, a song that held a special place in 11ven\u2019s childhood. \u201cIt\u2019s a song I always remember hearing. I later found out that my dad \u2013 who was a DJ \u2013 went on a date with Lisa and never really got over her. That\u2019s why the track was always playing at home!\u201d\\n\\n\\nHer music, made with women and girls in mind, has a resounding message of reassurance. 11ven says, \u201ceven though it\u2019s great to be a confident, sexy, fiery woman there\u2019s no problem with being vulnerable and being insecure sometimes. I think vulnerability and insecurity make women who they are and if we didn\u2019t have that, we wouldn\u2019t be women.\u201d",

Later on, influence from American Hip Hop Classics and New Jack Swing of the 90\u2019s led him to begin Break Dance. From then on, He has been around Japan to perform in events and clubs, on stage and TV, producing music free of any specific genre and have been receiving great support. On the other hand, he has also been doing work as a DJ as well as a track producer, producing all the performance music for these. During the late 90\u2019s to 2004, he received great influence from the growing party movement which led to his great interest in rave culture. Starting in 2002, he started traveling all over the world for almost 3 years, going around over 20 countries. During this period, he was able to experience various outdoor festivals as well as having chances to organize parties in Britain (London), India (Goa) and Japan (Tokyo). Currently he is concentrating on creating music basing himself in Britain (London).",

        "description": "Over 20 years deep (as of 2010) in buying and playing records, and there seems to be no end in sight. I've put on my own nights in various bars, pubs and clubs in Ayrshire (Scotland) and London, varying from hip hop (late 80's and 90's independent), house (deep, melodic, bass heavy sounds), funk, soul, and even indie nights.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a 10+ year hiatus from house music, I've found that it has come full circle and there are people like Linkwood (and the whole Prime Numbers and Firecracker Recordings crews), Cottam, 6th Borough Project, and Efdemin, amongst others that are putting heart and soul into making proper house music again. Special mentions must go to Eddie C, Intrusion, Wireman, Acos Coolkas and Sigha, who are all producing special things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as hip hop goes, it's always been about DITC, Godfather Don, Gangstarr, Big Daddy Kane, Marley Marl, Beatminerz, ATCQ and all those kinda cats, and more recently the late, great, oft-copied-never-matched, Jay Dee aka J Dilla.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor me, soul music cannot be bettered if it invloves, Marvin, Stevie, Curtis or Al. Other special people include Syl Johnson, Roberta Flack, and Marlena Shaw. Lesser known artists that have hardly put a foot wrong in their whole career include Harry Whitaker, and 24 Carat Black.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the people mentioned, and the artists that they influenced, play a part in the ever expanding shelves of flat black plastic that take up a couple of rooms in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I'm not listening to any of the above, I've probably got Belle \\u0026amp; Sebastian coming through the speakers!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways available for bookings in London, Manchester, Glasgow or any of the surrounding areas. Please send a message through Soundcloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy the mixes, and if it's got an ounce of soul, I hope you'll hear it in the sounds I post here.",

A passion for detailed harmonies continued through various choirs, including the OneTaste choir and London Contempory Voices, all the while working as guest vocalist for a number of dance and indie bands, numerous collaborations with MC PRofit, as well as collaborating with producers on her self penned songs. \\n\\nSome years performing and releasing music as Neech saw performances at local venues up and down the country as well as festivals and competitions. A strong connection was forged with her regular guitarist Oliver Thompson and they enjoyed co-writing songs for the project, but the changing band line ups eventually took it's toll.\\n\\nA move to Paris resulted in a stint presenting and producing the Paris branch of online music show BalconyTV. This also led to time away from making her own music, as so much energy went onto promoting other artists. But Oscine continued to write lyrics. Thankfully Oscine was introduced to Congolese musician Borrina Mapaka and the pair set about making plans to collaborate. Oscine returned to London but the musical force was strong and ideas were floated across the Channel. This led to a return trip to Paris to record vocals and work on specific tracks with Borrina, which were then brought back to London to be mixed by Pyramid Studios' own Dave Pemberton. \\n\\nHaving met Dave through recommendation by PRofit, Oscine has found a like minded musical soul. With all the pieces starting to fall into place more recording and live shows can only follow.\\n\\n\\",

I love music and rhyming, but before all that I was adj, a bedroom dj and a street dancer, when I was really young, I say that cause now Im called old school. I've been messing with sequencers and vst pluggins, seems for ever. Just something I was always doing and only my friends was hearing it and given me alot of respect for what I was doing, but the best comments I think are the ones you get, is the ones from people you don't even know, well thats what I think anyway. I won't go on.\\n\\nNow I've thrown all that away, well put it on hold and got myself a Maschine Mikro. Took off the Reason and cubase and started all over again. I've always wanted to get a MPC, knew friends who had it, but they never showed me how to use it or they didn't want to, I  never got round to it and was planning to until I read up on the Maschine, plus I had the right amount of cash in my pocket, when I visited the music shop and it didn't cost me much, which was perfect. Now Im up learning more than I have ever before and loving it. \\n\\nOnce I have more knowledge and confidence, I ll start producing for some vocalist, rappers and of course myself.\\n\\nI have been seeing this soundcloud on my facebook for years and I have finally got an account. Please support me and give me some guidance on this musical journey, its all about the love. I will add you to my page. I love hip hop, reggae, soul, funk, dubstep and many more, the list goes on",

Having worked there as a singles buyer for Dance \\u0026 Hip Hop got me very into music and opened my horizon to different music genres. At this point I was Dj'ing with 'Family Affair' who organised parties in studios and warehouses in and around London. I was playing House \\u0026 Underground Garage at the time. Our most memorable event was the boat parties at Temple Pier by the Embankement. This was held every Sunday from 10am till 1am. Most of the crowd came straight from Ministry Of Sound. It was absolutely heaving every weekend! I played with Stretch, Tony Graver, John Stansfield \\u0026 Mickey Simms. During this summer I played at Ministry Of Sound for three month in the VIP lounge. I have also played abroad including Elba (Italy), tour of Egypt \\u0026 Dahab and Stockholm. Have been support DJ for Nicolette (Shut Up \\u0026 Dance Records). Since then I have had to focus on my Graphic Design career. I have sold my decks and record collection and have now gone totally digital using my MacBook Pro and Reloop Digital Jockey unit. Still get together with DJ friends for a mix now and then. We do occasionally put on private parties and DJ in bars. Still got the bug! My musical inspiration in my sets vary from Detroit Techno, Funk \\u0026 Jazz to Hip Hop. Below is a list of DJ's and Producers I rate as my favourite:\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2022 Ramon Tapia\\r\\n\u2022 Oxia\\r\\n\u2022 Hector Cuento\\r\\n\u2022 Shur-I-Kan\\r\\n\u2022 Milton Jackson\\r\\n\u2022 Jimpster\\r\\n\u2022 Lawnchair Generals\\r\\n\u2022 Tommy Largo\\r\\n\u2022 Inland Knights\\r\\n\u2022 Mark Farina\\r\\n\\r\\nI would describe my sets as being Funk fuelled Deep House with a Tech Housey underbelly!!??

        "description": "Travis Blaque, an artist who views the world through cynical eyes while struggling to balance the duality of human consciousness. Blaque represents the ying and yang of life. The constant battle between good and evil that wages within us, no matter how well-balanced or good-natured we may consider ourselves to be. The first appearance of this darker lyrical persona would be on the Ollie Teeba-produced single \u201cDead Weight\u201d, a heavy slice of hip hop that found Travis unleashing his understated lyrical fury on the competition with unique results. This would soon be followed by another irony-fuelled cut, \u201cThe Bachelors\u201d, which came with a remix by stateside production sensation RJD2. Since then Travis has also toured across Europe with underground West Coast favourites Ugly Duckling, stopping off for a successful 2004 performance at London\u2019s Jazz Caf\u00e9 before gigging throughout 2005.\\n\\nHis most recent work, the highly-anticipated long-player debut \u201cThe Many Facets Of\u2026\u201d is an unpredictable blend of sounds and styles that refuses to bow down to preconceptions or rap-related stereotypes. Yes, Travis Blaque is hip hop, but this is hip hop music in the true sense of the term, showcasing an artist who is determined to remain himself in today\u2019s fickle celebrity-obsessed world whilst simultaneously entertaining and educating his isteners. From the sleazy sexploitation tales of \u201cIn Pursuit Of The Flesh\u201d to the analysis of race relations on \u201cRaymond Cist\u201d, the content of \u201cThe Many Facets Of\u2026\u201d is always challenging and thought-provoking.",

The night attracted a whole host of music lovers who were later to go on and have their own success including Depeche Mode and Boy George. Alex formed a reputation as a rapper and by \u201986 had formed a DJ/Rap collective called the Radical Crew. The radical crew occasionally played alongside the soundsystem known as \u201cMetro\u201d that went onto become Renegade Soundwave sound-system, the band who from the mid-Eighties, have influenced some of the biggest names in UK dance: The Prodigy, Chemical Brothers and Underworld. The band were signed to Mute Records and released several records including the massive club hit \u201cThe Phantom\u201d.  They were on the same circuit as all the main sound-systems, including Soul II Soul. Alex formed his own pirate radio DJ collective called The Smart Boys. It was their radio shows and the club nights, which Alex DJed at, that were to go on and inspire the rest of Border Crossing. Catch AJ on unknownfm.net every thursday 12-2 ",

        "description": "Since I first picked up a guitar at 13 years old, I have always wanted to write songs, and it\u2019s what I\u2019ve spent most of my life doing. Starting at first in my spare time, it soon became something I did constantly, when I realised I wanted to try and do it for a living. I couldn\u2019t see myself doing anything else. I\u2019ve tried \u2013 I\u2019ve had numerous jobs, left a steady career, as music has always called within me to follow its pull- and I do every day with passion.\\n\\nThe things I love about music the most are: the people I\u2019ve met over the years; playing shows; collaborating with other fellow musicians; networking and meeting anybody and everybody imaginable. It\u2019s about the friends you make, the characters and different type of people who watch the shows, the moment you connect with somebody and make new fans; the other artists; the sound men; the promoters, the DJS, the media, the press and everybody else I\u2019m forgetting to mention .It\u2019s an incredible journey, and one which has taken me all over the world. It\u2019s given me glory, and has also taken it away. It\u2019s affected my personal life massively \u2013 seen me win and lose love, given me the hardest times as well as the most amazing experiences I\u2019ll always be grateful for. \\n\\nThe music I make tends to be related to my journey, the things I\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019ve felt, and the lessons I\u2019ve learnt. I take inspiration from other people\u2019s lives, but mainly my own. \\n\\nI\u2019m influenced by everything I hear when I make music. I\u2019ve gone through periods of DnB, R\\u0026B, hip hop, rock, pop and grime, so my music taste is varied and my music has evolved and has elements of all of these. However, you could say a blend of the soul of Paulo Nutini, the big sound of Imagine Dragons, with the catchiness of Ed Sheeran. I play 8 instruments, write and produce my own music and have spent the last 12 months solidly recording. I\u2019m releasing the first of these songs \u2013 BHU on 27th February 2018. Be sure to like my Facebook page so you don\u2019t miss the release and my other songs throughout the year.\\n\\nIn 2018 I\u2019ll be getting as much music out as I can. I\u2019ve been working on a new musical project for a year now, and it\u2019s finally ready, so I can\u2019t wait to get it out. I\u2019ll be releasing singles and videos throughout the year, so stay up to date with them all by following all my socials \u2013 Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.\\n\\nI frequently play shows around the south east and in London but I am hoping to expand to other cities this year. Have a look at my gig listing here, to see if there\u2019s one close by. If not send me a message and we can try and organise one together.\\n\\nNate OUT!",

        "description": "From an early age Talis was exposed to a mixture of progressive rock, jazz, soul, and good quality pop. Neither of his parents were musicians but their expansive record collection and love affair with music in general left an everlasting mark. As with most, Talis moved through musical phases. His earliest memory of a distinct sound discovered away from early tutorage was 90s Hip Hop, and in particular the creative sampling it is renowned for. This was followed by a sustained interest in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and indie, which saw him pick up his first six string. It is a genre of music which is very part of his influences today.\\r\\n \\r\\nA keen guitarist Talis thought he had found his home, but when he reached his late teens that was all to change. Electronic music was the light opening greater possibilities of being even more creative. An area of music not bound by block verses, bridges and choruses, this was a chance to create something that evolves, and stand the test of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith many years of club culture absorbed through experiences across the world, including a number of DJ sets in Berlin, Ibiza, Manchester and London, Talis is set to become an established member of the dance music community as a DJ/Producer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor booking enquiries/remix requests please email: talisren@outlook.com",

Its been a massive shock to all his friends and family,especailly his mum and dad ,sister and wife Polly and has 2 children,Mya \\u0026 Logan. Life will never be the same again. He was the most charasmatic person ever, He had an amazing sense of humour and was the man who kept the partys going and brought joy to those who were down and was full of wise words.Always telling jokes his laugh and smile was infectious.He loved his footy and was a dedicated Chelsea fan. Words cannot explain how much we all miss him. We met at School when i moved to Bicester it was my first Maths lesson , he was sat next to me and we clicked just like that. We loved the same computer games , same clothes , and the same music - Hip Hop and at the time Hardcore rave.We shared Tapes and collected flyers all the time, got decks and did loads of random pub and club gigs around Oxford , Didcot , Banbury , Wantage, illegal raves in Luton and High wycombe we went everywhere. , he was my Raving partner , we did the Sancturary all the time in Milton Keynes and Diehard in Leicester they were both our regular hideouts lol!. We both had a passion for music and it was that ,that brought us to a freindship that brought many other people and familys together. I thank his wife Polly for passing his collection of Tapes over. I wanted to share his old rave tapes with you all cause i know he would want that and i will be upgrading this site in the near future for more uploads. I hope that these all bring you all back some of the best memorys with freinds like they do for me with Michael. Great times , Crazy times , unforgettable times. We love and Miss you mate so much  Please feel free to make a donation via paypal, as the proceeds will go to his 2 Children Mya \\u0026 Logan (Pollyarthur77@yahoo.co.uk). Many thanks and hope you enjoy the tunes. RIP - MICHAEL xxx  ",

        "description": "In July 2011 Hannah Howes drove 6000km around Europe, performing at festivals and boutique venues in nine European countries with Ben Lemi. Two months earlier she traveled by shinkansen across Honshu and Kyushu, with a guitar on her back and a film crew in tow, playing to appreciative live houses and to Kyotos underground artists, played solo between rock acts in Kuala Lumpur and dealt some healthy tunes to Singaporeans on a diet of fizzy-pop music. \\r\\n\\r\\nHannah Howes has played at most major New Zealand festivals since 2004 (Rippon Afterparty, Destinations, Soundsplash, Kaikoura Roots, Nelson Arts, Dunedin Fringe, Parihaka International Peace Festival, Riverside Music Festival, Eudaemony Solstice, Newtown Festival, Cause, Uprising and more.) She has toured her homeland a dozen times and celebrated three independently released albums, distributed through Rhythmethod Distribution in NZ. In 2009 she played a series of sold-out shows in Japan, and recorded with Tokyo based label, \u2018Apple Paint Factory\u2019 and securing distribution through Dub Store Sound Inc (Japan).\\r\\n\\r\\n'Intelligent... pure and under-stated' \u2013 NZ Musician Magazine\\r\\n\\r\\nHowes\u2019 NZ airplay skyrocketed in 2004 when she performed the festival circuit as MC-sing-J \u2018Sista Mischief\u2019 with roots DJs and breaks producer, Ecophonik, and released her debut album \u2018Patchwork Quilt\u2019 in the same year, also getting play listed in Australia. Noted as a female role model in a male-dominated reggae scene she performed a number of reggae festivals and support slots wowing audiences as a soloist before headliners, including Cornerstone Roots and Wicked Draw. The combination of \u2018troubadour\u2019 lyrics, reggae rhythms, social commentary and dub effects, earned her status as \u2018the inventor of a new genre of music- \u2018folk-dub\u2019 after the release of her first live album, recorded at Wellington\u2019s Bodega Bar in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\n'Intelligent, ambitious and unpretentious... Howes speaks to the heart, brain and soul' \u2013Dunedin Fringe\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2009, Howes produced and released her \u2018Candy\u2019 LP in New Zealand, featuring fourteen of NZ\u2019s most sought after musicians from the alt country, hip-hop, reggae, iwi and roots arenas. Engineered by Lee Prebble (Best Engineer 2010, NZ Music Awards) at \u2018The Surgery\u2019 and mastered by Don Bartley (Australia) at Benchmark, the album received rave reviews, with Radio NZ National\u2019s Manu Taylor stating:\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2018Great voice, great interpretation\u2026 Brilliant\u2026 She\u2019s Genius.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'Compelling vocals, sumptuous soul\u2026 multi-layered, to the beat, back-up' \u2013 Groove Guide\\r\\n\\r\\n'Compelling singer and storyteller' \u2013 Dominion Post\\r\\n\\r\\n'clearly articulated philosophies and dreamy lyrics' \u2013 Critic Magazine\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2018Like Cat Power\u2026 with shades of Feist\u2019 \u2013 The Press\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2018Anything but disposable, sugary pop\u2026 rather an intelligent, smooth, mellow offering...

        "description": "Born and raised in Finsbury Park Rebel Frenzee has been writing songs since he could talk and been rapping for fifteen years. He attended St Aidans, the same primary school as UK Chart Sensation Chipmunk and Highgate Wood Secondary School at the same time as Sway, during which time he setup an old school garage crew known as the Lil Big Kru (LBK) with Shifty and Silo, then recruiting Bombay, JK, DJ Starr, Haze and Sativa. The crew split after it got involved in gang beefs, but Shifty and Rebel Frenzee started up The Strikt Reality Crew with singer/rapper Locker G. \\r\\nFrenzee was persuaded to get off the roads whilst he was living in Hornsey YMCA by his mentor Peter Isaac, who along with his friend pushed Frenzee to make a legal career. Shifty was locked up by the man, but Frenzee and Locker G started hitting the circuit performing at around two shows a week. They received amazing response, even at open mics were they were the only hip hop artists people were calling them the best acts of the evening, especially with there tongue and cheek track \u201cYour Girlfriend\u201d speaking about how they were planning to sleep with someone else\u2019s girlfriend. Frenzee also started organizing events and programming stages for festivals including the Restore The Rec, Tottenham Carnival and Wood Green Car Free Day. They performed regularly with drummer Steve Clarke, who had performed with rock giants Def Leopard, Led Zeppelin and toured with Motorhead.\\r\\nIn 2010 he became part of the Tottenham Carnival Planning Committee and a director at the huge venue Tottenham Chances. He organized the charity event \u201cBun Da Gun, Vibes Not Knives\u201d featuring some of the best up and coming talent in Tottenham including Karim K2, Leigh Marco, XYM, Laila, Supreme G, Essence and Dreddmarc amongst others. He also started managing other artists, who he felt were different. \\r\\nIn 2009 Frenzee reverted to Islam and his music became much more focused around the morals he was trying to promote. From then on he has continued to perform at many open mics and festivals. He worked for WAYFMag filming, organizing events and writing articles for six months and still helps out with the magazine. He then linked up with S Man and helped him setup ILoveMuzic, promoting unsigned artists, were they worked with Fatima Mohammed of Double Platinum Hungarian group Fekete Vonat, X Factor Bootcampers 4Real and up \\u0026 coming Finsbury Park Rapper Avalanch. Most recently he performed in Netherlands were he linked up with Dutch Rappers Black Rose Rebelz who he is helping to tour the UK in May. \\r\\nFrenzee\u2019s music is very diverse and can go from commercial love songs to gritty revolutionary tracks to conscious songs about improving our society. There are not many artists like Frenzee, who is also respected within the community in Tottenham and has worked on many projects with community workers there and has been quoted in the local press on more than one occasion.\\r\\n2012 is surely going to be a big year for Frenzee as he pushes to create a mixtape unlike any other, with something for everyone.\\r\\n",

        "description": "Bengali - Rapper - London\\r\\n\\r\\nMy parents originally from Bangladesh moved to North London (Camden) where I was born in the mid 80's at a time when Hip Hop started getting noticed and developing into mainstream music. The genre was a movement and the era of 'gangsta rap' came over from the US. When I was around 10 years of age I stole one of my uncle's tapes and was endlessly playing it regardless of my parent's disapproval, I didn't understand much of the lyrics back then but was amazed by the swearing and rawness that I had never heard before. The album was 'Ready to Die' by Notorious BIG and it was 'cool', rap music was different, rebellious and interesting enough to turn me in to a fanatic.\\r\\n\\r\\nI loved the art of how a lyricist can create something out of nothing using only pen, paper and obviously the most important thing an imagination if not your own life experiences. As I grew older my album collection grew bigger, classic albums such as 'All Eyez On Me', 'Capital Punishment', 'Life After Death', 'Enter the Wu Tang', 'The Infamous' and 'Reasonable Doubt', even the new classics such as 'The Marshall Mathers LP', 'Stillmatic' and 'The Blueprint' just to name a few were influential through my life. But one album did more...even though it was released 6 years before I first heard it; it was fresh and still better than most albums selling at that time. It pushed boundaries and set a mark for all emcees to look upon whilst releasing their own rap albums. The album was called 'Illmatic' By Nas which turned me to start writing and rapping my own lyrics. I would constantly rhyme words in my head like freestyling except nobody would hear it until I got confident enough to make a mix tape with US hip hop instrumentals and me rapping my lyrics on it using a cheap mic and recording it all on my home pc. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter people heard my cd they wanted to hear more and one friend arranged a spot to battle on stage with other emcees on a tournament called 'Jumpoff'. I was quite naive and 19 at the time I was poorly prepared and was booed off stage and the crowd hated me, they couldn't understand my flow. I didn't really care because just for a few moments on stage I felt a buzz which I wanted to feel again. I've constantly been writing but never recorded another mix tape again since my first one. Now I'm back and I'm motivated more than ever to record and release more music, I'm looking to work with other artists, singers, and producers of different genres of music, get in touch through my Facebook or Twitter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace\\r\\nKam",

Aided by over a decade of passion for Drum \\u0026 Bass, Footwork and Halftime beats, Cortek is expanding his skillset and represents the future of the scene with previous radio shows on the likes of Radar. \\n\\nHaving grown up around the Bristol jungliest region, Cortek infused with his own love for hip-hop, Drum and bass and ambient dub through labels such as Metalheadz, Critical and Deep Heads. This built him up with quite a mixed spectrum of musical influence.  Today, this translates into his sets where he picks apart and combines together all the pieces of this music: beautiful synth work, ethereal backdrops, brooding basslines, and occasional vocal hooks.\\n\\nCortek found his passion for performing during several years of playing at the biggest clubs in Nottingham including The Brickworks, Stealth \\u0026 Rescue Rooms. Here he honed his craft as a support DJ, learning to read crowds and figure out exactly what works musically at the appropriate times of the night; how to build up crowds or shell down depending if billed to play before or after hard-hitting, globally touring acts including Alex Perez, Rockwell, S.P.Y, DJ Hype, Wilkinson, Etherwood, TC, Rene La Vice and Dismantle.\\n\\nAfter finishing with promoting a dnb night in the midlands Cortek decided to make a move back to London to focus on his music and radio production in a more concentrated hub of deeper and further experimental dnb. \\n\\nSince then Cortek has had several appearances on Radar Radio hosting the Telah Beats show, working towards being the hub for all things Halftime dnb.\\n\\n\\nContact: cortekmusic@gmail.com",

        "description": "With a sweet blend of smooth soul, epic instrumentation and lyrics which will cause you to stop and think twice - South London has birthed a new artist who is set to accomplish more than just entertainment. Her passion and determination to inspire others is poured out into what can be described as an \u2018eclectic\u2019 range of music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe charismatic sound of Santhy Mercado captures the essence of what seems to be an addictive innocence. From Soulful sounds to a taste of commercial R\\u0026B and Hip-Hop as well as a sprinkle of Pop, Santhy has a varied taste in music which spreads to the love of Reggae, Indie, Funk, Alternative and Gospel. Her diverse taste in music mirrors her multicultural background of Indian, Filipino, Spanish and Japanese. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe discovered her love of music from the day she could pick up a mic, however her passion grew from the day her mother bought her, her first Piano which at the time was bigger than her arms could reach. That day was the day a songwriter was born...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI grew up listening to my dad playing Bob Marley and Marvin Gaye on Vinyl and Indian music on cassette tape. My mum used to always play ABBA and Eva Cassidy, The Carpenters and Whitney Houston. So I grew up with a range of different music playing around me, which is probably why I love all sorts, and I\u2019d like to think it comes through in what I make. Although I must say, my heart is in the soul!\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHer heart is poured out into each song, and as a writer, you will no doubt fall in love with the message she has to give, combined with melodies that perfectly match each lyric.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\u201cI write most of my music, which I prefer to do. Even composing - playing the piano really helps. It\u2019s almost like therapy, when I play, I forget about my worries. Kind of like when I have conversations with God \u2013 it\u2019s like the music rises to Him and He takes care of everything else. I feel like there\u2019s no point in being an artist if you\u2019re not going to write your music, or have a huge involvement in it, because then it\u2019s not yours. What you are singing about would just be pointless...\u201d\\r\\n",

        "description": "R-Van is a compilation of talents that instantly steals breath. Creative percussion has been in his life since an early age.   As a teenager, he came to be inspired by Daft punk and 90s house, as he was similarly interested by oriental music when on summer holidays in Tunisia.  At about 18, he was thinking in terms of syncopated blends, while stirred by deejing and house music, first trying to create unexpected remixes using acapellas from hip hop, RnB or old school house with electronic music. With a growing fan base, he got the opportunity to play more and more in Paris in clubs such as Folies Bergere, Cab, Batofar, and the Ozu club. He was known for challenging Parisian sophistication, taking risks and creating his own imprint. When invited to play at \u201cLa Fete de l\u2019Humanite\u201d, the biggest outside festival in France twice, he played an extended set in front of 2000 people.  More inspired, he realized he wanted to share his music even more, moving to London to express this new aspiration.  He became a major player in the vibrant underground scene in 2011 by promoting and headlining several successful parties at The Egg, The Brewhouse, Horse \\u0026 Groom, Bells of Shoreditch, and Blackall studios, Shutterbug, Trapeze, Ace hotel, Cuckoo club and many more. A fan of production led him to create his own label, Eagervision Records in 2015 to enable emerging talents to express their music and develop talent. When he plays, R-Van begins a new journey of music discovery, always seeking to connect with the feelings of the crowd. His sets are a blend of soulful house, groovy beats with some percussions, tinged with uplifting melodies. He now aspires to produce more and more tracks that matches the style of his live sets, with cutting-edge upcoming house tracks due to be released in the coming year.",

His focus is the promotion and interaction with Dancehall, Reggae and Soca music which is primarily played on his show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stimulation sound (his shows name) provides the listener with both the newest and most well known artistes dancehall and reggae has to offer. His innovative style and ability to play upcoming artistes has gained him great respect within these genres giving the people an opportunity to hear the full elements of Jamaican and Caribbean inspired music.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Wine is also an artiste and producer who originally started his career within the Hip Hop genre, in which he was known as Nemesis working as a duo act with artiste Arrogance (as in Nemesis and Arrogance). The pair produced 2 albums which were released into major outlet high stores like HMV by independent record label Real Records.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore information on his earlier career can be found at the below link.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_%26_Arrogance\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently White Wine is more commonly known for his interviews with artistes worldwide and aims to give the fans a chance to learn more about the people behind the music they love so much. With recent artistes such as Charlie Black, RDX, Leftside, Warrior King, Khalilah Rose, Patexx, Macka Diamond, Sheba and many more joining his show in 2012, we can only imagine what he will have planned for the future\\r\\n",

He loves what he does, always has, always will and seriously wants you to feel the enjoyment he gets from it. Simple as.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy you should listen\\r\\n\\r\\nHis skills on the turntables allow him to manipulate all genres of music into something original that, trust me, will, have the most reserved of you out there on the dance floor!\\r\\nWhy you should watch\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a turntabelist is an art, do something different. Get involved and support UK talent whilst being part of an experimental new genre of music.\\r\\n(Plus he plays wicked tunes!)\\r\\nWhy is he different?\\r\\n\\r\\nCurls is a very private person and wants you to respond to the way he plays music, not him. He believes the man (or woman) on the street knows what the man (or woman) on the street wants to hear best and that\u2019s what he brings you, pure entertainment. He keeps his ear to the ground and is constantly looking at ways to challenge himself and the listener by presenting you with types of music you may not expect to hear, breaking boundaries and never categorising music, using scratching and beat juggling to make a tune his own, in a way straight DJing just can\u2019t do. Turntabelists like Curls can go from Hip hop to old school with a sample of Frank Sinatra in the middle in the space of minutes, in a way that sounds professional, new and different but mostly just sounds good and looks spectacular\\r\\nTrust me; don\u2019t just take my word for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy;\\r\\n'Im Different'\\r\\n\\r\\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Catch me every sunday on urbanfmtv.com 8-10pm !!!!!!!!!!!\\r\\n",

His musical journey started when he was 9 with guitar lessons but he soon found electronic music and very quickly moved to the dance music scene. Starting out as a drum n' bass and hip hop DJ and then 7 years ago he discovered his passion for psychedelic trance, motivated by the friendly parties and the cutting edge music being played at them. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe culmination of Matt's experience is his exciting new project Mind Sweep. This is a fresh sonic outlook on his style, and strongly influenced by the new upsurge of the 'tech' style of psychedelic trance. Mind Sweep brings you deep baselines buried beneath atmospheric and hypnotic soundscapes with a fusion of digital and analogue production techniques, giving his music a powerful lucidity that resonates with hyper-charged dancefloors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatt's unrelenting passion and his fearsome energy have found an affinity within this new sound that is at the cutting edge of psychedelic music. This new musical direction opens up the doorway for him to beautifully express the raw energy that is packed into his personality, bringing to life the intense energies that permeate his existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow working with such artists as Endeavour, Disorder, Intelligence as well as some solo material, you can expect to see this new project  being released soon on Mutagen Records and other record labels around the world.\\r\\n",

What a wait! By profession, I am a professional Artist (painter) and have been for over 25 years. I produce Airbrush Artwork on canvas, portraits murals, children's rooms and theming. (Please check out my Facebook pages linked below to see my work.) In the past, I have been known for my Kustom Painting \\u0026 International Airbrush Art Classes with Organic Image but these days I am concentrating on a more personal, contemporary set of Artworks, producing my stylised 'organic' images for gallery exhibitions and private sales/commissions. I now have a new Mac with garageband and once i realised I could edit stuff in layers and add instruments, there was no stopping me! I love movie making too and i am currently editing a film to go along with this 45 min mix.\\r\\nAll the trax on this mix have been mixed old skool style! by that, I mean I treated it like mixing on a turntable so: in Audacity, I first changed the BPM of the track percent-by-percent until i had it worked out perfectly. To help me ascertain the BPM I used a tapping app. I set the BPM for this at 128 in GB and then created some loops, my favourite for this mix is from the Incredible Bongo Beat Band - Apache, used in many old skool Hip hop and breakin tracks. The mix covers pop, old skool B-Boy, a bit of party and then more up-to-date pop.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you enjoy it! I spent 3 months putting it all together in my spare time and creatively, it is something I am incredibly proud of. I see it as a piece crafted, as one of my paintings would be and I NEVER get tired of listening to it! Thnks for listening ~ Beej",

David's hunger for music expanded to the likes of TLC, Missy Elliot, Jamiroquai and the Spice Girls during his early years. \\r\\n\\r\\nDavid didn't understand the inner city mentality but felt connected to his working class roots, which first turned his passionate confusion into street and contemporary dance. Entering nationwide dance competitions, studying performing arts in secondary school and film studies in university; David pushed his way onto the theatrical stage and stood in the spotlight as a hype man for other artists. Soon after he was inspired to write raps of his own. \\r\\n\\r\\nShames' Platonic Adonis EP is an explicit, comical although eyebrow raising social commentary about sex in the media, sex in London and the lack of sex in his life. Referencing the likes of Quentin Crisp, Oscar Wilde and Dizzee Rascal, Shames is the unafraid and unapologetic mirror in the society he has grown up in.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired by 'Wham' and 'Madonna' Shames successfully bridges the gap between rap and pop by spitting over the top lyrics that already has listeners laughing in public and rewinding his songs in disbelief. Shames' extends his musical approach to his personal style. Whether he is wearing a tight belly shirt or his baggy Nike tracksuit he exudes a hip hop confidence and presence that is reminiscent of artists like Jay Z.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready working on his second EP Shames is determined to raise the musical standards and expectations of black rappers and rap in general. He will not be ignored.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\",

I\u2019m 30 and live in London, I was born in Derby and when I was 2 my parents moved to Cape Town, South Africa where stayed until I was 14 and then moved to Durban,South Africa till i finished  school at 18 and then I came to England and am still here today. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was very much into music at a young age and didn\u2019t play any instruments personally so my attention turned to the radio. I always thought of becoming a Radio DJ as I liked to play music all day. When I was 16 I started going to clubs, just small ones that I could sneak into! This is when I sawing DJing for the first time, the real DJing. This is when it became my dream and I wanted to be up there playing my music! \\r\\n\\r\\nI was still young with just a pizza delivery job I knew I would never be able to afford turntables so I had to wait a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nI started work at a music store in Westville, Durban called Musica. I was 16 \u00bd at the time and stayed for there for 2 years. During these two years my appreciation and knowledge for music grew from reggae to soul, rap to hip hop, rock to metal and dance to trance. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the club scene started in South Africa I listened to speed garage and acid house,Toni de vet style.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to England in 1998 my mate introduced me to Psy trance. I really got into trance music and my immediate favourites where Infected Mushrooms, Tip Records, Silicon Sound and Flying Rhyno and in the present allaby,zen mechanics and burin noise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being in England for 3 years I got my first set of decks in 2001, after lots of saving and partying I got part of what I wanted. I knew of the Psy Dream Temple I got introduced to progress psy trance and really got into it. I\u2019ve been into it for the last 8 years and I really enjoyed mixing it. My favourite artists range from D-Nox \\u0026 Beckers, Freq, Yotopia, Phony Orphants, Son Kite, Perfect Stranger, Ace Ventaure, Liquid Soul, Ticon. The dj\u2019s I most like are D-Nox, Emok and the Great James Monro but also as the time has gone buy my intrest turn to minimal , techno and my fave the psy mininal techno. Artists such as alter breed,duca,Tribal vision records\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006 i was doin a internet  radio show every Saturday on World dance FM,a show called Tribal Tabs with a friend ,and at that time  became a resident for the Psy Dream Temple ,a shop in Camden that started throwin proggresive partys ,Where i have opened for acts such as D-NOX \\u0026 BEKERS,TEGMA,VIBRASPHERE,BRISKER\\u0026MANGITMAN,DJ SLATER,GAUDIUM to name a few and  since then gigs have been regular and recently played at GLADE 2009 in the psy form tent and recently been signed to Mutagen Record as a Dj .......anyway hope you enjoy the mixes ,, easy          ",

I understand people and I make friends very easily. I also like talking to people to hear people\u2019s stories, this sometimes can give me an influence on a song. I would like to consider myself someone who can relate to anyone and any culture and background. So for me possessing such good people skills and creating music go hand in hand. I have good leadership qualities and am confident of myself, also when performing my music I feel you need confidence to engage with the crowd.\\n\\nMy style of music is quite versatile; I can often go from one sound to another without losing flavor.

        "description": "Sophie-Loval is a multifaceted British talent. At her core she\u2019s a singer-song writer, but her skills don\u2019t stop there. Also an actress and model, her days being raised in Ibiza have served her well. \\n\\nNow ready to unveil her debut album, an electro pop affair infused with soul, the music seductively weaves the grit and reality of London living with the rebellious, carefree ethos of Ibiza. This tension that exists between two worlds is kept throughout her album, the lyrics displaying an insight into the growing pains of a young woman determined to develop a stand-alone spirit in the face of bitter challenges. Tracks such as \u201cInner city child\u201d and \u201cTeach me\u201d reveal a painful honesty that many would hide from. Sophie also brings to light questions of sexual identity, fitting in, wanting to be liked and having a sense of belonging. \\n\\nThis is an album that knows no boundaries. Hardly surprising as Sophie cites a myriad of eclectic musical influences and loves that have helped shape her sound. From the production skills of Apparat to the deep folksy tones of Terry Callier. The hip-hop beats of Nas and Busta Rhymes. Linkin Park to Jack White and the Gorillaz, as well as the frank rhymes of Etta Bond, her modern day contemporary.\\n\\nThen there\u2019s the voice. With a perhaps unexpected depth, Sophie\u2019s vocal has a habit of making the hairs on your skin stand on end. Deeply grounded and self-assured, her voice is also reminiscent of the depth and urgency associated with Etta James in all its Motown quality. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Sophie is an old soul, the power and force of her lyrics better served by such a voice.\\n\\nTaking it back to the beginning, Sophie believes her upbringing has stood her well for the journey ahead. Both her parents provided a strong creative foundation for her early life. Sophie\u2019s mother was a pivotal figure in the fashion industry in the UK before lending her knowledge and skills to the isle of Ibiza while her father is a talented musician. Thus, she grew up surrounded by a strong sense of freedom and creativity. But while Sophie\u2019s\u2019 childhood in Ibiza may sound idyllic and whilst it was full of sunny days, it wasn\u2019t without hardship; her mother, Rachel had arrived in Ibiza as a single parent with three children under five years old. \\n\\n\u201cShe knew there was no way she could bring the three of us up in London, unless it was a life on benefits. She wanted so much more for us girls.\u201d Her mother instilled a sense of self-belief in making the impossible possible and proved it with her own success. She also introduced Sophie to Nichiren Buddhism, which is a life affirming philosophy based on a respect for oneself and others. \u201cI feel very lucky to understand the power of faith. It is a practical tool that I have used often to push myself past my fears and transform dark times into light.\u201d Sophie\u2019s passion was further ignited when she moved to London full time, and decided that music was her life and focus.\\n\\nWith that determination in her heart, Sophie\u2019s lyricism changed dramatically when she started writing poetry.  \u2018I started to really open up, stopped pretending life was always wonderful. I changed something inside myself. I think it was the fear of being totally vulnerable. But in that vulnerability I found strength and now I feel I can really express who I really am.\u201d\\n\\nOver the last month Sophie's Album, Paying Back My Childhood Debt, slated for a 2017 release, has been taking shape between a well reputed north London studio and her fathers studio in Ireland alongside some amazing established talents including Stuart Ross, Spider J, Urban Monk, Potent Whisper and Africa Nile to name a few. Sophie has also been involved in various music projects such as On Track, BBC Documentary \u2013 Charli XCX The F word and me, Music Potential \\u0026 The Amy Winehouse Foundation. \\n\\nWith time \\u0026 talent on her side we are expecting great things from this ambitious island girl.",

        "description": "Shady Supreme wrote his first rhymes at the tender age of 10. Having never had anything but a passing interest in hip hop music at the time, he was able to craft a verse with ease while at the same time discovering something that would be his solace for dark times ahead.\\nBy the age of 17, Supreme (also now known as The Soul Search Drifter and The Blacksmith), started working with other artists in his local area and was a member of some underground groups. He eventually ended up forming a group called Wanted Recordz with friends from school, College and local MCs.\\n\\nHaving initially started with 8 members, Wanted Recordz eventually became a four artist group. Along with his crew,  Supreme did shows all over London including Vibrations in Burgess Park, Kingston Works, talent shows in Norwood,  Sports bar and Strawberry Moons in west end, Ntyce in Woolwich, Kingston University and also shows in other regions including Cardiff, Rochester, Crawley, Bournemouth (supporting Sway). \\n\\nDue to his undying loyalty and commitment to his group (which now only consists of him and Scarz), Shady Supreme has had little or no time to really push ahead with his own music career. However, that has now changed with Supreme releasing a mixtape in 2008 called \u2018The Supremo Vol.1\u2019 which has been followed up with another called \u2018Middlemania\u2019 in 2010 and the release of a video from it called \u2018Swear Down\u2019 which will be airing in Sky channel  Flava TV very soon. A follow up mixtape called 'Organized Rhyme' was released in 2013.\\n\\nWhat separates Supreme from other artists in his genre? Let him tell it: \u201cI would describe my music as sophisticated street music. It requires a level of intelligence. Even when I\u2019m doing commercial tracks, you will still appreciate that a certain amount of thought process has gone into the lyrics. I don\u2019t patronise fans. I\u2019m a conceptionist if such a word exists, so fans will never be bored\u201d.\\nShady Supreme\u2019s artistry knows no bounds especially in the realms of lyricism and this, more than anything, should stand him in great stead for the future. \\n\\n",

The trio are brothers with the same dream, hence the clever play on the band name. The band hail from the South of London where they grew up influenced by all types of music from, hip hop, to indie rock, to reggae and more. However it is difficult to categorise their music as they\u2019ve been told by many, though if they did have to categorise the genre of their music it would have to be a great blend between indie rock and hip hop. Not only do the group produce for then selves they also have been producing and writing for other artist. 3.R.D were also approached by an American marketing company and online radio stations after hearing some of their work on the net, they worked together creating jingles for advertisements.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently 3.R.D are in the midst of recording their 1st EP the \u201cUnlabelled Project\u201d with the 1st single of the EP \u201cRed Town\u201d due to be released in the year 2013, along with the video. Whilst waiting for a release date to be finalised 3.R.D have been performing at various venues creating a huge buzz for themselves, including winning the Live and Unsigned competition in May 2013.\\r\\nThe group was formed in 2010, when the brothers decided to build a home studio and develop their skills as producers\u2019 song writers and rappers. In 2011 they were signed to Mk Vibe record label for 6 months after deciding to be released from the contract to manage themselves and their music independently. The group has recently been a part of the Choice FMs Music Potential Programme where they were recognised by Xeon (wretch 32 manager) and Collin basta (Devlins\u2019 manager) for their production skills. Since then the group have been working at the Urban Chain Studios in south London Penge towards releasing their EP which has been influenced by various genres including indie rock.    \\r\\n3.R.Ds 1st single 'Red Town' is about breaking through into the industry, and losing control breaking free from the bondage of dreams just being dreams and not becoming a reality for some. The track is about letting yourself go and going crazy for what you believe. This track was written and created by the group and has been loved and requested at performances. 'Red Town' is due to be a big track for 2013.",

With a style that incorporates everything from Electro House to Hip Hop, he is a versatile club DJ, comfortable in front of any crowd.\\n\\nJames Spencer has a wide range of experience in the UK's major cities, having started his DJ career at the young age of 11 doing mobile discos for people his age. At the age of just 15, he managed to come third in an Under 18 DJ contest, which brought a host of new opportunities in many up market London clubs. This lead to bookings from some of Soho and Mayfair's most exclusive clubs, performing alongside the likes of Tim Westwood and DJ Semtex, and a spot on the prestigious company Uptown Events. \\n\\nIn 2006, James formed Allure Events, a corporate events company with the aim of breaking into a whole new market.\\n\\nThis added to his experience in hosting, organising and co-ordinating events. Moreover, in 2009, another company Ice Breaker was created, which caters for the Under 18 market.\\n\\nFrom all this he began to build a fan base and start a weekly club night called 'Fusion Fridays', which along with his mixtapes, have been key reasons for his rapid growth in popularity.\\n\\nIn September 2010, James moved to Birmingham in order to establish himself in a new scene, gigging at The HMV Institute, Custard Factory, Air, The Guild and Chameleon Bar in his opening month. James is currently taking bookings for Club Nights, Corporate Events and private functions, so please visit www.djjamesspencer.com for more info on how to make a booking.",

It was a natural progression to getting my first pair of decks in '96 and from day one I began to cultivate a diverse record collection. My early interest in house, hip hop and jungle eventually led me to explore the genres from which they evolved, drawing me in to the worlds of disco, funk, soul, jazz and reggae. Staying pure to the vinyl form I continue crate digging to this day, always hoping to find a rare original or discover a new artist or label.

Originally hailing from The Sunshine Coast, Eastbourne Town, with stints in Reading and London they bring over 20 years worth of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrought up on the sounds of reggae they turned their attention to hip-hop and breakdancing in the late 90's. Matt's studies in music (BA Hons, Cello Grade 8 Distinction, 15yrs bass guitar) allowed him the opportunity to play at some great venues including the Royal Albert Hall, St. John's Smith Square and the Brighton Centre along with tours to Barcelona and Northern France. A bad shoulder injury incurred in 2003 meant a switch to behind the mixing desk for a couple of years. Josh started his musical career by learning keyboards when he was younger before carving out a path as first a hip-hop mc and then moving the focus more towards grime. In 2005 they decided to bring their experience and talent together and formed Neurotic Fix.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from representing the artists on the label, Neurotic Fix also offers services to assist other musicians and producers. We can provide professional standard string parts and bass guitar riffs, lead and/or backing vocals, arrangements and extra production.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any questions, would like to find out more, or to book Neurotic Fix or Flaming Vest for live performances, please send us an email neuroticfix@gmail.com\\r\\n",

        "description": "FOR COLLABORATIONS OR BOOKINGS PLEASE INBOX OR EMAIL: nodkramma@hotmail.com\\r\\n\\r\\nI\u2019ve always been fanatical about music. As a kid in my early teenage years I was obsessed with Hip Hop and that obsession hasn\u2019t faded into adulthood. I love and the respect the culture and its associative art forms. After dabbling in DJ\u2019ing and Graffiti writing, it became patently evident I should stick to emceeing! I began making music, with varying degrees of success, at the age of fourteen alongside Karnate (DJ/Producer) and Mindstate (Emcee). Together we formed the UK Hip Hop collective \u2018Foreground\u2019 and endeavoured to record an E.P. Shortly after Foreground\u2019s establishment, the group enlisted another member, Smoqui Pipes (Emcee). As a four man team, in 2006 we released our 22 track debut mixtape \u2018The FG Mixtape\u2019 featuring other local talent including; Quick Buck Duck (Producer), Mr 6 (Emcee) and Reckless (Emcee). \u2018The FG Mixtape\u2019 would prove to be Foreground\u2019s only release as the collective subsequently disbanded to work on respective solo projects and other artistic ventures.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, myself and Karnate decided to create LazyPerfectionist Productions. Now working under the LazyPerfectionist guise artists formerly associated with Foreground began surmounting solo bodies of work. Additionally, the label took on two incredibly talented new artists, Rory P (Emcee) and Lil Phil (Producer). Artists such as myself, Karnate, Mindstate, Smoqui Pipes, Rory P, Lil Phil and Mr 6 collaborated with one another to great artistic effect. LazyPerfectionist Productions is progressively becoming more and more established and eventually plans to branch out into other creative avenues including; creating a diverse Youtube channel (LPTV) and manufacturing a clothing line.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\u2019d just like to take this opportunity to shout out local artists that have had an influential effect on the local scene or have worked hard to achieve success and recognition. I do not personally know all of these individuals, however, respect their work ethic and impact: Defcon (Natty \\u0026 Dwella), Digit (Baggy Flag), Edixion (Chameleon Records), Dubz, Mr 6, Dan Manic, Mr Basista, Danny Who, Dan Lambert, DJ Dubl \\u0026 Bruno Balanta.\\r\\n\\r\\n",

I grew up with motown, disco, jazz funk, reggae and ska during the seventies... in the 80's we popped to electro \\u0026 hip-hop then partied to underground club sounds like original NY garage and rare grooves until a new style of club music from Chicago called House smacked us all in the face and quickly developing into Acid House kicking us all up the backside! In the 90's my ears were alight with NY House and New Jersey Garage which lead to the whole UK 4x4 Garage and 2-Step scenes evolving into a darker uprising throughout the noughties\u2026 For me 'House' is where you live and 'Garage' is where you park your car...

Headhunted by a popular Urban webzine, EricaSharlette joined as Client Relationship Manager at the end of December 2010. Endeavours for the publication led her to Hip Hop Artist and Music Producer Lekhem in January of 2011, when EricaSharlette advanced to the magazine\u2019s writing staff for Fashion, Arts and Events. The promotion of a friend led EricaSharlette to DJ Melody Kane. Hitting it off instantly, Kane brought what was now a budding promotions company on-board, to help spread the word of her ground-breaking movement, the Female DJ Takeover.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the spring of 2011, the ESP name had begun to build a reputation through the demonstration of hard work, dedication and commitment to each affiliate brand and numerous ad hoc projects. That name reached the ears of Hip Hop Artist Drassick DIGITAL in April of 2011, who also joined the long-term ESP roster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ESP website and \u2018The ES in the P\u2019 blog launched on the 12th September 2011, just in time to begin a full promotional drive for Leela James\u2019 only European date, for her sold out \u2018My Soul\u2019 concert tour, just over a month later. Aimed at tailoring promotion on a fresh, personal level; both were integral to the Marketing plan. Less than a fortnight after both sites launched, RnB Superstar, Hollywood Actor and New York Times\u2019 Best Seller Tyrese Gibson hand-selected \u2018The ES in the P\u2019, as one of the few worldwide outlets to review his music video for \u2018Stay\u2019. Featuring Oscar nominee, Taraji P. Henson and directed by critically-acclaimed, Matt Alonzo - the single marked his first musical release in five years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2018The ES in the P\u2019 entered a new phase at the start of 2012, with a greater variety and selection of written articles. The #FindOutFriday feature that had received some of the biggest feedback during the \u2018My Soul\u2019 concert promotion returned; with a weekly roster of varied artists, known and unknown, from all walks of the Entertainment Industry. Talents such as Def Jam US\u2019 Kevin Writer, top Brit-pop girl band StooShe, R\\u0026B Specialist DJ Ronnie Herel and Music Video Producer and Director, Carly Cussen have all graced the hotseat; with many more inspirational talents to come!",

        "description": "Hubie was raised by a pack of techno-loving wolves in the wilds of Austria many full moons ago and it was this upbringing that led him to become a DJ today. As well as learning how to hunt antelope, Hubie's pack taught him the fine skills of beat matching without opposable thumbs, EQing and, most important of all, tune selection. \\r\\n\\r\\nArmed with this knowledge, Hubie reluctantly left his pack and moved to the even greater wilds of London to seek his fortune in the music industry. A few minutes after he arrived it dawned on him that there was no money in music whatsoever, so instead he changed tack and decided to spin his favourite tunes to packed bars and clubs in exchange for warm flat pints of cider and the occasional half empty packet of twiglets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his bookings built up, Hubie decided to branch out into the exciting world of internet radio, beginning his radio career on Brap.FM. Spinning on Brap was like returning to his loving wolf pack back home - comfortable, warm and friendly - but after a couple of years he realised that he needed to expand and challenge himself further, so when the multi-award-winning NSB Radio came a-calling, Hubie muddled his metaphors, jumped ship and joined the most popular breakbeat radio station on the planet.\\r\\n\\r\\nHubie now hosts a fortnightly radio show on nsbradio.co.uk, cunningly titled Hubie Sounds, playing to hundreds of listeners from all over the world. He also continues to DJ around the UK, spinning all sorts of music - breaks, house, electro, funk, hip hop... you name it, he plays it - apart from dubstep, which is actually a very dirty word where he comes from in Austria, fact fans (but given enough flat cider and twiglets, he's been known to play that too, just don't tell his mum).\\r\\n\\r\\nTo find out more about Hubie, there's a really cool wolf enclosure at London Zoo that can tell you all you need to know about his species and genus. Or alternatively check out his various interwebbings...",

Continued my love of music with mainly Hip Hop, then into the dance music scene around 1991 listening to pirates in London such as 88.4 Hardcore FM, Sunrise, Rush, Defection and Kool.  Started buying tunes in 1992, got decks and started making tapes, playing small house parties and illegal raves in woods.  First rave/club I attended was at Rocket on Holloway Road in 1993 and it spiralled from there.  Moved away from London was I was 16 and put on the first weekly jungle/d\\u0026b night in Norwich with friends, had DJ SS, Mickey Finn, Roni Size, Dr S Gachet etc all come and play sets.  Slowly drifted out of DJing professionally when I got a 'real job'.  Boring.  Love for the music was rekindled recently mainly by Doc Scott's Future Beats Vol1 (and the rest of the Volumes) and new crisp productions by Need For Mirrors, Enei, Jubei, Andy Skopes, Ant TC1 etc which proved there was still decent D\\u0026B being made.  Watch this space for my own productions soon...  Thanks for reading.  Peace.",

        "description": "From his earliest recollections, Beatnik Rubaine has savoured the sounds of many forms of music. He grew to love and appreciate how music stirred people and soon decided that he wanted to move the music that moved the people. By the mid-80\u2019s; he was DJing at many wedding, boat cruises and house parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, Beatnik formed a DJ crew, called the Beatnik Academy. Modelled after \u201cThe Groove Collective\u201d A New York based collective of DJs, Artists and Musicians, Beatnik Academy\u2019s aim was to develop a musical and artistic scene with in Bermuda that would that was based around creativity and imagination and would allow some of Bermuda\u2019s most skilful Djs, Artist and Musicians the opportunity to perform at events where they could display their talents and grow artistically. It was during this time that he met young DJ - Kaos \u2013 exciting things developed from this alliance. Beatnik Academy had been hosting and Djing at many of the Island\u2019s famed \u2018Underground\u2019 parties, at venues such as Oscar\u2019s, (Victoria St) Show Bizz (corner of King St \\u0026 Reid) to name a few that attracted a mix between Bermudian and European crowds looking for an alternative to the stagnated club scene, when the idea for FLOW Sundays was developed. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeatnik had been influenced by the Acid Jazz scene in the underground night clubs and cafes of Lower Manhattan, and he wanted to promote that level of diversity, creativity, and freedom of the oral and musical tradition in Bermuda. Along with Andre Simons and Suzanne Mayall, he wanted to challenge the boundaries of traditional expressions, and produce something that was always fresh and vibrant. He succeeded. Beginning in 1997, the popular FLOW nights attracted many of Bermuda\u2019s most talented rappers, singers, poets, and musicians. They often performed original material before appreciative audiences at the Coconut Rock\u2019s, Bourbon Street Lounge in Hamilton. FLOW provided much-needed, uncensored opportunities for Bermuda\u2019s artistic community to voice their gifts, find support, and to network to further expand the art on the Island. FLOW eventually ceased, but not before it gave rise to, what some have described, as a \u2018Spoken Word Revival.\u2019 This led to the opening of Nenu Letu \u2013 which closed in 2002, and Chewstick \u2013 which continues the rich heritage today.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeatnik once described the DJ as one who has skills in \u201cmanipulating the records,\u201d adding that it is a \u201cnatural desire ... to take something and add on to it.\u201d The artistic DJ, can take the music you\u2019ve heard on the radio, and make it unique and special all over again. Beatnik became the official DJ of the Bermuda International Film Festival from 1998 to 2001. This allowed him to share a more eclectic mix of music from his personal record collection at the Festival\u2019s social events, which included launch parties, wrap and boat parties, and Happy Hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis skilful \u201cturntablist\u201d has rocked the house at Bounty Killer, Busta Rhymes, and the Lost Boys concerts. As a member of the Beatnik Academy, he has DJ\u2019ed along with celebrities, Kid Capri and Jazzy Jeff. He has also charged the atmosphere of art exhibitions for International artists, like \u2013 Manual Palicio and Bruce Stuart, as well as at countless beach parties, house parties, cruise boat parties, and Poetry \\u0026 Book Festivals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeatnik has hosted radio programs Street Vibes \\u0026 Changez (Riddim) Excursions (Bermuda) \u2013 which was 4 hours of Hip-Hop, R \\u0026 B, Raggae and more on VSB Mix 106. He worked with DJ\u2019s \u2018Scientist\u2019 and \u2018Bussy Dread\u2019 to co-produce and to co-host Street Vibes with DJ Kaos. These popular shows, later known as the DJ sessions, ran for two hours on Sunday afternoons, and became one of the best music programs on local radio.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeatnik had the great experience of Super Legal (Brazilian Super Cool) on Smoke FM on Sunday afternoons in the UK. He enjoyed his time on Smoke because he got to \u201cspin funky, groovy, soulful vibes - everything from Pharoah Sanders and J-Dilla.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May, 2004, Beatnik moved to London. And just two years later, he formed Spredluv - a Collective now hosting two monthly live music and DJ events in and around London. He is thrilled with its success, which has already far exceeded expectations. In 2008, he re-launched FLOW, which continues the legacy of showcasing some of the finest young talent from around the world. Since Beatnik has moved to London, he has DJed at numerous Clubs and DJ bars, most notably The Met Bar on Hyde Park corner and Cafe` de Paris in Leicester Square. Recently he DJed at the launch of MTV\u2019s new music and entertainment channel, Viva. He has also DJed at other events including, corporate functions, weddings, and house and boat parties. He has also worked as a grill chef for award winning restaurant \u2018Leon\u2019 and appeared as an extra on films such as \u2018A good night\u2019 starring Danny DeVito and Gwyneth Paltrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with this amazing record of experiences, the work of this free-spirited trailblazer in the art of the Spoken Word is by no means summed up. His innovation continues ... as does his journey.",

        "description": "Uptown Safari was originally set up as a club night residency in the mid nougties by producer/D.J\u2019s Andy - Yam Who? and Toni - Blackbeard at the Notting Hill Arts Club in London. The boys started this road-blocked Saturday night session as an outlet to play some of the cutting edge music they were both producing at the time alongside some of the more commonly known R\u2019n\u2019B, Hip Hop and crossover Soul music heard in the Charts. The monthly Saturday night became such a success that both producers would end up remixing the likes of John Legend, Grace Jones, Joss Stone, Jill Scott \\u0026 Zero 7, to name a few, and as a result they would play their sound at clubs, bars \\u0026 festivals not only in the U.K but as far as Japan \\u0026 The USA, and including legendary clubs such as Fabric, Ministry Of Sound \\u0026 The End.\\nToday Andy - Yam Who? still produces \\u0026 D.J\u2019s and has his own record label Ism Recordings, whilst Toni \u2013 Blackbeard D.J\u2019s all over the capital with  various residencies, including The House of St Barnabas in Soho. Toni also runs a logistics business when not behind the decks, driving the likes of De La Soul.\\nOver the years we would get asked if we could play at friend\u2019s weddings or colleague\u2019s corporate hospitality events and we decided why should we not offer our style and sound to those who want it outside of the club land scene! \\nOffering a bespoke service and style to those who want something special \\u0026 memorable, whether it be for your friend\u2019s wedding, birthday, or any other event you are organising, Uptown Safari will be refreshingly different to the typically generic, cheesy and out of touch wedding d.j that you would find in abundance out there.\\nWhy not give the Uptown Safari Sound to everybody.\\n\\n\\n",

        "description": "Originating from Italian and Indonesian blood, Laszlo wanted to discover the world on an early age. She was born in The Netherlands, where she was mesmerized by her grandparents when they sang Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. With those experiences fresh in her mind she started to take piano lessons. Soon, due to her inexhaustible energy and inability to sit still for too long, she also took dancing classes at age five. At first it was classical ballet followed by street dance, finally progressing to breakdance and hip-hop. At the age of ten she wanted to try something new and so started an acting course. She loved singing, dancing and acting so much that the step to full stage theatrical productions, including musicals, was easily made \u2013 performing in Never Ending Story, Hamlet and Romeo \\u0026 Juliet.\\n\\nWhen she was eighteen she left her home in the Netherlands and set sail for Milan, Italy. Here her musical journey continued as she participated in the Italian X-Factor with the group \u201cSisters of Soul\u201d. They broke through the hundreds of applicants to the live shows, reaching the fifth round. This beautiful experience gave her a taste for more and two years later she found herself in the big apple, New York City, on a three months exploration. Here she had the opportunity to expand her international music network and to develop and hone in on her own style.\\n\\nSoon after New York City, she visited London and fell in love with the city and its variety of inspirations. After four years back home in The Netherlands, it was time to move back to the city that captured her imagination, London. With new energy and much more worldly experience she is based in London now, where she is busy writing her first album entitled F.L.A.G. - For Love And Glory.",

She spent 5 years of her youth living in Cordoba experiencing constant racism, discrimination and kidnap before she decided to immigrate permanently to London, UK. Rebecca lived her teenage life bouncing around Europe from country to country. With her constant rolling stone lifestyle and dysfunctional upbringing she dropped out of school at the age of 13 where she discovered herself through music and built a platform for herself.  Although Rebecca struggled expressing her feelings, she embraced her journey and emotions and put it all in her music. She then realised music would give her a voice and was determined to unite all those affected by discrimination, segregation, hatred, physical and mental abuse and poverty.  \\n\\n\\nAt seventeen siblings rivalry was aggravated by her alter-ego \u201cRexy Mendez\u201d, when she shot to life. \u201cRexy\u201d is a combination of Rebecca and sexy, it originated as Rebecca was treated like a real life version of Cinderella. She was shone away by her family when they imprisoned her in the family home, abandoned her and left to another country. Music was her prince charming, saving and sheltering her from pain and sorrow.  \\n\\n\\nHer musical backgrounds were awakened by her story and influences such as Nina Simone, Tupac, and many more. With her passion for music, Mendez incorporates her emotions and the power of her voice to explore different genres of music such as soul, rap, hip-hop and RNB. \\n\\n\\nRexy is currently based in London, UK pursuing her dream of becoming an international artiste. She quotes \u201cI\u2019m not here to be loved, I\u2019m here to be heard\u201d. \\n",

The topic and subject matter is what can only be described as grown folks B.I. where Kingkaz tackles his expansion in many compartments\u2026of\u2026yes\u2026his own life.\\n\\nSo one highly recommend you purchase this My Life EP and lend your support for a multi-faceted company certainly on its way upwards, this year, and into the future!\\n-----\\nThe much anticipated release from SpiritMan titled 'My Life', a 5 track) digital EP is out Now. Available on all top sites including iTunes.\\n\\nThis EP is not to be confused with the sometimes repetitive songs we hear on our airwaves, My Life is a breath of fresh air. With chords, beats, rhythm and lyrical substance all colliding in perfect harmony, this one is not to be slept on.\\n\\nMicstagesuk.wordpress.com \\n\\n\u2022 Twitter.com/kingkazofficial \\n\u2022 www.facebook.com/kingkazofficial\\n\u2022 Youtube.com/bbless9 \\n\\nBudabless Records Public Relations Email: budablessrecordz@gmail.com",

        "description": "UK based Reggae Dancehall Artist Staggabakk, is the latest of naturally gifted Jamaicans set to have a major impact on the music industry. His talent has no boundaries and he is limitless with the things he can achieve. Ever since he discovered his ability to write lyrics and rap to a beat, his confidence has propelled him forward onto a journey he never thought possible.\\nBorn in Spanish Town, Saint Catherine, Jamaica, Christopher Sappleton aka Staggabakk has always had a passion for performing and being creative. Growing up, he captured the ears, eyes and heart of many locals in his community with his energetic, charismatic and passionate performances on various talent shows. He was supported by friends and family, especially his mother who he sees as his mentor and the reason behind him doing music altogether. She persuaded him to travel to the UK in 1999, so that he could experience a wider culture of music, learn from other musicians and develop into a more versatile artist, like his idol Bob Marley did.\\nStaggabakk brings a fresh style that forms the perfect blend of Reggae and Dancehall music. He sees himself as an international artist who appeals to the masses. \u201cAll I\u2019ve ever wanted growing up is to be heard and taken seriously, music gives me the opportunity to do this, I believe through my songs, people will get to understand my journey and know who Staggabakk is\u201d says the artist.\\nIn a recent interview he was asked where he got his name from and his response was \u2018Stagaback is a kind of sweetie in Jamaica. I would often go to the shop to buy these sweets and on one particular day the shopkeeper (Mrs. Johnson) saw me coming and shouted, \u2018Stagaback\u2019 (as she knew that was what I was going to buy) since then I\u2019ve claimed it as my pet name, in Jamaica you are given a pet name that sticks with you for life. I had to change the spelling to Staggabakk for copywriting purposes.\u2019 \\nStaggabakk had written and co produced his debut album \u2018Wot A Gwan\u2019. \u201cThis album is me finding my feet, getting to know who I am and where I stand as an artist. I wanted to prove to myself and all who doubted me, that anything is possible if you put your mind to it\u201d, Stated the man himself. Wot A Gwan was released in 2014 by Zojak Worldwide Music Distributors based in the USA.\\nStaggabakk has written and co-produced his second album entitled \u2018\u2019Still Believe\u2019\u2019 which he hopes to release later this year. The first single entitled \u201cOh Yes\u2019\u2019 is a blend between Dancehall and Hip Hop, It has a catchy chorus and thumping baseline which are the perfect ingredients for a hit.  The video is available on YouTube and www.staggabakk.com the artist\u2019s own website.  The 2nd single from the new album \u201cAgain \\u0026 Again\u201d will be released on 5th September 2016 and will be available for download on ITunes, Google Play Store and other digital distributors.\\nPlease follow Staggabakk on various social media outlets (Twitter, Facebook, Instragram, YouTube, Google, Snapchat).

        "description": "For the love of music it is always there for you\\r\\nwhen you are happy or sad...My musical journey started with Reggae and Soul why? because that is what I was exposed to at the time. Then in the late 70's'Hip Hop' emerged my first expression was 'WOW' and this would not be the last time that word was used. Moving on to the mid 80's there was a new sound coming out of Chicago... House music was born and would change the landscape forever. All my friends said 'Why are you listening to that 'noise' my response was 'I will ask you a question and we will see what happens in 5 years time' they laughed. In less than 3 years we were going to Genesis, Biology and Raindance to name a few...what was the question? 'You may not like it now but you will love it soon' . In the early 90's AWOL at the Paradise Club, The Sunday Roast, Thunder and Joy, Jungle Fever brought forward Jungle and D\\u0026B with some legendary nights (and days loool) then came the time for UKG with the mighty STUSH (big up Rob and Dennis) and Twice as Nice to name a few.....this is just a brief overview of my musical journey and it continues....For the love of music.....:-)\\r\\n\\r\\n",

HIP- HOP, RNB , SLOW JAMZ, RAP\\nI started DJ  around 10 years ago in Peterborough, where I was playing after party for the biggest Polish Hip Hop group WWO \\nNext night was another biggest Polish hip hop artist O.S.T.R\\nIt all happened just like that and I already had a ticket to Poland. After I moved back to my country I had a few nights in my city, but then I moved to Warsaw to try something different. \\nI didnt have time to do DJ-ing over there and after couple of months I decided to go back to my city and study massage.\\nWhile studying I started DJ- ing again. I was a resident in one of the nightclubs, where we were holding Hip- Hop Fridays.\\nI also did few hip hop festivals and streetball competitions. \\nAgain I had a chance to play after parties for biggest Polish Hip hop artists such as Pezet, Bez Cenzury, Malolat\\nAlso was invited to play at Polish hip hop night in Peterborough and London, where I flew for the weekend.\\nIn 2010 I moved to London and I sold my equipment. I stopped Dj-ing and also stopped dancing. Both were a really big part of my life back home. In 2015 I decided to do some Dj-ing courses in London, I got my new equipment and now I am back to what i love..",

I was born and raised in Cardiff, but moved to London after graduating college.\\n\\nAt the moment I work as a marketing executive for a man and van company in London. Small moves at affordable prices are our speciality, but we also occasionally do house and office removals. We have a team of carefully picked and well trained movers whom we always trust to provide the highest of quality moving services. Our team always works with top notch packing materials and boxes when on an item packing job. That's right we also do item packing. You can request this service when you hire our man with van services or when we're moving your home.\\nSome of our other services include: eBay collection, storage, end of tenancy cleaning, rubbish removals and more.\\n\\nOur customer call centre is operational 24/7 all year long, so when you need to make a booking, you can literally do it any time.\\n\\nAs far as music goes, I don\u2019t consider myself a metal head, but if there\u2019s one style of music I listen to most of the time it\u2019s that. I also love other genres of course. I\u2019m into reggae, hip hop a little bit of electronica and all variations and hybrids between these styles.\\n\\n\\n",

My DJ sets are wide ranging, cherry picking from the best RnB, hip hop, house and disco with an emphasis on fun, similar to the styles of Dimitri From Paris and Todd Terje. Whilst I view myself as a rookie DJ, I've played at many of London's best venues ranging from Shoreditch's car park party spaces to the Bloomsbury Ballrooms and have promoted my own successful club nights. This is a kind of second coming for me as I took time off from DJing to finish University and go traveling and now intend to reignite my love for the decks.\\nAnd yes, Adam Street is my real name.",

        "description": "Well where do I begin, let\u2019s just say that I\u2019ve been involved in playing and producing music on and off for the last 25 errrr! a lot of years (yes I am younger then I look-YEAH RIGHT!). I started playing music as a DJ when I was 15 years old or should I say selecting music because I wasn\u2019t in a position to buy the music at the time for my cousin Eddie\u2019s sound system called \u201cSoularkus\u201d (don\u2019t ask me what it means) when they played a couple of parties. My cousin was impressed with my knowledge so when I approached him about putting together my own sound system he agreed to help. So BAS3 was born. The creation, which consisted of myself and my cousins Woodhouse \\u0026 Adonte. I had been playing out as a DJ for a number of years before I ended up doing any form of radio. My first look in was with two employees of a now defunct TV hire company. They were Ben West and Chris Phillips (www.jazzfm.com/) and the station was called Radio Activity (Yeah very creative). Well, I did one show on there \\u0026 the phone lines blew up. So much so that within two weeks the station changed it\u2019s name to Starpoint FM with a 100% R\\u0026B Hip-hop format. It spawned loads of good people like Chris Phillips, Wilber Willberforce (1Xtra), Maxi Jazz (Faithless), Carl Lewis (Starpoint Radio)  and probably a few more I don\u2019t remember, aaah good times, I still have that first show on tape somewhere \\u0026 might upload it one day for fun. I sort of dropped out of radio stuff once it all went legal (too ugly for radio) and spent some time concentrating on raising some boys. I got a little bit board with being domestic and started helping my partner with some events called BWIM \\u0026 BMIM \u2013 Black Women/Men In Music which showcased the best in UK artist performing with a live band in a great setting. We got a lot of props for the show \\u0026 actually helped a couple of them get on their way to getting record or publishing deals. I am currently doing a little bit of podcasting \\u0026 ad voice-overs (good work when you can get it) and I\u2019m currently part of Raydeoh which is part internet radio and podcasting and a few other side projects. It all seems like fun again.",

        "description": "Daniel Olubanjo (born November 8 1998), who goes by the stage name Faiyabrand, is a UK-based rapper, songwriter and music producer. He is mentored by Tim Omotoso, the senior pastor and founder of Jesus Dominion International. Faiyabrand was born at University College Hospital (UCH) and grew up in Kilburn, North West London. He was raised by both parents, Olufemi Olubanjo and Blessing Olubanjo, and is the eldest of his two brothers, Emmanuel and David.\\n\\nFaiyabrand has recorded a single titled 'Blessingz', released in August 2017; his 1st Single album which is a fusion of afrobeats, trap and hip hop. The beat was produced in Nigeria by Dawie, the vocals recorded by Joules Productions at London Recording Studios and the track was mastered in Nigeria by URS Upparuum Studios.\\n\\nFaiyabrand has always had a musical influence right from an early age, and comes from a Christian family with a musical background. His mother Blessing Olubanjo is a gospel singer herself, and his mentor Tim Omotoso is a highly gifted musician in over 50 musical instruments by the grace of God. During his primary education, he vaguely learrned to play different instruments from his friends such as violin, saxophone and recorder. He took guitar lessons from year 3 to year 6 and became the lead guitarist in his school in year 5, performing at their church and assemblies. Interested in several instruments, he became self taught to play the piano and the drum kit.\\n\\nFaiyabrand began rapping at the age of 11 as a hobby when he attended Capital City Academy, inspired by fellow friends who aspired to become professional musicians. During his teenage years, he was a troublesome and curious student who had a negative reputation for getting into fights and causing havoc. However, after being exposed to the opportunity to make music in a small studio at his school, Faiyabrand adopted a passion for music composition, and in year 9 he started to upload his musical creations onto YouTube, but not as anything serious. By year 10, he decided he wanted to take up music seriously, so he took it as a GCSE, in which he attained an A* in performance, and an A in composition. Faiyabrand continued to expand his musical knowledge by studying Music Technology (sound engineering and music business) at City of Westminster College. While in college, he developed his production skills and his knowledge and appreciation of various music genres and began to work with college friends and small upcoming artists. Faiyabrand has performed at several shows and has worked with several artists including Paigey Cakey, Tizzy, The GXFT, Alpha the Producer, Shoggy Tosh and HenriSoul. Furthermore, he is working on his own production label 'Myrical Music' as well as his career as a rapper.\\n\\nFaiyabrand used to be known by few as Mista Lyrical; a nickname he adopted from fellow schoolmates due to his lyrical wordplay during secondary school. However, he felt he needed a name that better reflected his \\",

        "description": "Meshack is the real name of the thirty one year old gifted lyricist ISO of the Dark Sides Isotopes.\\r\\nBorn and raised in West London ISO is a passionate poet that has a unique voice and flow which he delivers in an authentic English accent. ISO's fascinations with words was the driver behind him studying A level English in 2002, his aim was to gain a greater insight into the world of linguistics which he could then apply to his verses.\\r\\n\\r\\nISO views rap as being his therapeutic means of expression \u2013 defining RAP as Rhythm-And- Poetry. His carefully constructed verses are full of catchy wordplay, meaningful statements and creative concepts which he fuses with abstract tracks to produce an invigorating and inspirational sound.\\r\\nISO uses his experiences and aspirations as a source of reference for all of his lyrics. He searches deep within himself for verses that give the listener an insight into his perceptions of life with what he calls \u2018musical monologues\u2019, capturing the audience\u2019s imagination with his fine selection of poetic devices coupled with the poignant pronunciation of his words.\\r\\n\\r\\nRap for ISO began before he turned into a teenager, his mother, brother and Grandmother we\u2019re all major influences. As a child he was exposed to a mixed variety of music genres such as Reggae, Rap, lover\u2019s rock and gospel church music \u2013 all of which are very powerful and were embraced by his family members just as strongly. It was during this childhood era that ISO's relationship with music and words was born.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp until the age of ten Shadrak would mimic his older brother\u2019s lyrics and beg him to write lyrics just so that he could recite them. He wanted to be like his older brother like any other kid.\\r\\nThe time came when he had to make what he regards now as a serious decision, an ultimatum. \\r\\nA close friend of his brother sat Shadrak and his then rapping partner down and asked whether they were going to continue to rap or if they felt it was not really for them, they were no older than eleven.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch to Shadraks surprise his partner admitted that he did not think he wanted to continue rapping and opted to drop out of the group there and then. It left Shadrak with a heartfelt decision as it meant to continue would mean going alone, writing and rapping alone. However, despite ISO's disappointment and uncertainty the decision did not take him very long.  He was staying.  \\r\\nIt is a moment he says he will never forget, he had mixed emotions from his friends resignation coupled with the affection he had developed for music. \\r\\n\\r\\nISO's decision making as a child has shaped his future, he had pledged his allegiance to RAP and vowed to continue and commit himself with the hope that one day he would realise a dream of flying the flag for British Hip Hop.\\r\\n",

        "description": " Darcus Knight, is the producer, songwriter and rapper hailing from Hounslow borough, West London. His eclectic mix of production and songwriting make him a definite one to watch. Darkus' musical journey begun in 2003, on the back of a 237 bus after over hearing two boys talking about the music production software, known as Fruity Loops. He was intrigued by the possibility of being able create music from scratch, and so got a friend to download the demo and burn it to cd.\\r\\n Initially his production was grime focused, inspired by the likes of Davinche, Wiley and JME as well as Mike Skinner. As his experience as a producer grew he began to expand his influences well beyond just urban, to acoustic artists and guitar bands, leading to him penning songs in these styles.\\r\\n\\r\\n Initial sounding  like other prominent british rappers, he soon begun creating his own style, heavily influenced by Mike Skinners, and his choice to write about everyday subject matter. After taking inspiration from alternative and folk artists, such as Citizen Cope, Florence and the Machine and Imogen Heap, Darcus added a more poetic imagery infused style of lyric writing, and a less traditional style of percussion. This lead to him being selected as 'Artist of the Week' and receiving airplay on BBC Radio, through the BBC Introducing programme. At the end of the year he was re-featured as one of the best featured artist of the year. This was under the alias of Courtney Alexander. He also sights Kanye West, Timbaland, Ray Charles, Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana as major influences on his sound.\\r\\n  \\r\\n  Following the milestone of receiving  BBC airplay, Darcus turned his attention to the engineering and the business elements of music industry; enrolling in a Music and Multimedia Technology foundation degree at West Thames College in Isleworth. This allowed him to develop engineering skills necessary for a professional producer, learning how to capture and process acoustic sound through knowledge of microphones, mixing desks and other industry standard hard and software. Instead of blowing his student loan within a week of receiving it, like a majority of his classmate, Darcus used a proportion of each loan payment to develop his home studio, purchasing an IMac, interface, monitors and a selection of software. After buying a secondhand Squire Strat guitar from a friend, his production style evolved again as it inspired the exploration of  Indie rock and Blues . Darkus begun blending these styles with Hip Hop and Grime, similar to how The Neptunes merged funk with Hip Hop.\\r\\nDuring his time study at West Thames College, his focus began to move away from ambitions of being a solo artist, and toward songwriting and production for his own his own label.\\r\\n\\r\\n  After completing his initial degree, Darcus progressed to the Music Technology Specialist BA Hons. Degree program at the London College of Music, an institution that has produced producer Alex Da Kidd ( Eminem, Dr Dre, T.I., Christina Aguilera and Skylar Grey), Robert Orton, the Grammy award winning Lady Gaga mix engineer and Freddie Mercury of Queen.\\r\\n  \\r\\n It was whilst a student at The London College of Music that Emerald City Records, a label and production house, was founded as part of a self directed project module. The label was created to provide a platform for forward thinking, experimental urban acts that attempt push the boundaries of the genre.\\r\\nCourtney creative abilities extend beyond just music, he has been published as a writer in RWD Mag, after winning an article writing competition. He has also got experience as a music video director and editor, a part of his skill set he plans to incorporate into the business, adding a video production service that would allow the label to offer all promotional services in house .\\r\\n",

All his life he\u2019s been an artist, whether it was sketching, jumping from wall to wall or making great music, he\u2019s treated every creative aspect of his life as an art form. He found his passion for music when he was very young but decided to take his career seriously when his friend died in 2016. His close friend was involved in a fatal stabbing, and he decided he would put the violence, drugs and weapons down and use his voice and talent to make this world a better place. The young generation is in a very bad place and the over-saturated music of this time isn\u2019t doing anything to help them, or educate them on the dangers of this world. He has taken it upon his shoulder to let the world know he doesn\u2019t need to promote drugs, violence and obscenity to make amazing trap and hip hop music, he uses his lyrics and flows to genuinely catch the listeners ears. His message is broad but ultimately shows the youth there is so much more to life than what meets the eye, especially in this day and age. His name is King David and he is here to truly change this world.",

        "description": "Odd Fusion was formed in 2014 at the University of East London and consists of seven talented musicians from different walks of life.\\r\\nThe name Odd Fusion was created to express the bands need for diversity within their sound, which takes a experimental approach while aiming to regroup different tones, rhythms and sounds to create a palette of vibrant and distinct colours. Their sound can be described as a risky and daring attempt at the blending of modernist ideas mixed with old-school techniques. Odd fusion consists of very different people who have very different ideas but in the end what brings them together is the fact they are extremely passionate and dedicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nT.Bear is one of the lead vocalist and lyricist hailing from East London, his musical background belongs in  the Hip Hop sphere, but his adaptability makes him capable of being a valid asset in any genre. He is a passionate artist, who's talent is only matched by his charisma.\\r\\nYuzrin Othman is the second  vocalist and guitarist and hails from Malaysia. His compositional skills on guitar are what helped the band gain inspiration, his motivation and good mood are an asset to the bands spirit.                                                                                                                                 \\r\\nJeremie Louis is the drummer and lyricist hailing from France. His vast knowledge of various musical genres and outspoken personality helps boost the bands motivation when needed. \\r\\nAndra Stalidzane is classically trained pianist and digital designer from Latvia. She is responsible for the bands album cover and  her technical knowledge has been essential in the bands progression.\\r\\nAsbati Bashir AKA Maff The Concept is one of the producers in the band, he is also a session vocalist and digital drummer who's knowledge of sampling has helped greatly during the creation process.\\r\\nPete Wrobel is from North East London and is the main technician of the band, he is part of the production team and ended up being the session bassist in Odd Fusion. His lively attitude and charismatic personality has given a lot of perspective on key points during the development of the songs.\\r\\nRob Joyce is the Bassist of the group and hails from London. His musical knowledge and understanding of theory helped to merge the pieces together.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether and with their combined knowledge and enthusiasm ODD FUSION represent the future of their generation exemplified through the various continental attributes, they manage to merge many cultures into one while maintaining their individual identities.\\r\\n\\r\\nFans that saw their live performance commented on their quality of their work and congratulated them for their originality.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir EP is due to be released at the end of the year on an undisclosed label.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n",

I have a very odd taste in music, I like heavy/thrash Metal, hip hop, rap, R'n'B,funk, soul, house, drum and bass, jungle, some pop, 60's, 80's, 90's 00's and some classical, basically I like anything that has a really loud and heavy beat! My Son continually complains that I play my music at home and in the car way too loud, however all his friends think I am great with all my music!!!!! I do have a bit of a bad track record when it comes to speakers, I blow them a lot. Since I passed my driving test in 1992 I have owned 5 cars and have blown the speakers in all of them at least twice. I have broken the stereo completely in the lounge, the TV speakers only work one side, as does my DAB speakers and last week the speakers on my PC have also blown! So as you can imagine I am an absolutely dangerous lunatic..........Its not my fault.........I just like da beat loud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Yet it\u2019s more than that. I constantly get told I go to everything, or how did I get there or know this person or oh wow how you get into that that\u2019s so cool.\\r\\nI decided to create a place that answered all these questions and a place to hold all my adventures.heart From travelling the world New York to Ghana to Paris to London. Going to concerts nonstop Drake, Trey Songz, Beyonce, Jay Z, Kayne West, Rihanna (as you may be able to tell I\u2019m a Hip-hop, R\\u0026B and rap kind of girl). To perfecting my hobby, my love of photography. Creating photo shoots and always learning, trying to show the world how it looks through my eyes.\\r\\nYou\u2019ll find so many different things here, my thoughts, my views, my vision, my adventures. Every day is an adventure and what you make it. And I plan to make the most of it, so grab your adventure gear and let\u2019s go, come exploring with me.\\r\\nOh and before I forget I have been asked why adventures of anne?!?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell I was telling my friend Mr C about going to the Beyonce \u201c4\u2033 album launch or meeting Trey Songz, something like that\u2026 (ok i\u2019m boasting a little but I\u2019m trying to get you to explore my site further, so sue me lol). When Mr C proclaimed \u201cYour life is like a reality show, if you had a show it would be called the adventures of anne.\u201d That was the BAM A HA moment. It started with my tumblr and has moved on to a website. I love having \u201cadventures\u201d and here\u2019s to thousands more. Most of my adventures are related to my Canon 600D (I love that little black box of gears),  head over to my gallery for pictures galore, it\u2019s my favourite part of my site and adventures. I took the majority of pictures with a couple of expectations (like the one\u2019s I\u2019m in lol). So buckle up, I hope you enjoy all my adventures.\\r\\nAnne (who has adventures) x",

        "description": "North London rap collective Sindecut spent their early days performing at the Swiss Cottage Community Centre, before releasing an eponymous debut single in 1986. Other members congregated around the nucleus of rapper Crazy Noddy and DJ Fingers, including Lyne Lyn (rapper), DJ Don\u2019t Ramp (producer), Mix Man G, Mad P and, later, Spike Tee and Louise Francis. Various members travelled to America in 1987/8 to get a contract with B-Boy Records, but lost out on the chance when label boss Bill Kamarra was sent to prison. They elected to set up their own label, Jgunglelist, instead (an interesting use of the term before it was hijacked by the \u2018jungle\u2019 club movement). The Sindecut made their name with the infectious rhythms of \u2018Posse\u2019. It was an imposing stew of ragga vocals and hip-hop breaks. Their first club hit, though, was \u2018Sindecut Kickin\u2019 Yeah\u2019, on another independent label, Baad. They grew up with the similarly formulated Soul II Soul, merging soul and reggae with rap: \u2018Its just our influences really. Americans have a lot of influences but they tend to make one type of music. We want to make music that we are influenced by and put it together into a new sound\u2019. Their debut album showcased raps backed by orchestrated strings and frantic live drums - an almost \u2018new age\u2019 hip-hop affair.",

        "description": "'The OST Presents: Previously Unreleased' is a brand new concept in DJing, by your main men Lixx and Triangulator (www.soundcloud.com/triangulator www.mixcloud.com/triangulator). Our plan is to put on a club night where ALL the music played on the night is previously unreleased and by unsigned acts. The music will be credited on the night, as it is being played, as well as afterwards online. It is an opportunity for less established artists to break away from reliance on internet promotion and actually get their tracks played out in venues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night will be held in London, UK, but we will accept music from anywhere in the World. We cannot guarantee that we will play every track that we are sent, but we will listen to everything we are sent. A big question in this is 'what defines unreleased?'. Of course, these days pretty much everyone puts their music up online and a lot of people offer downloads. For this particular purpose, we do not consider that to be a 'release' - as long as it has been done independently and not through a record label. Similarly, if you have released music on a physical format (CD, vinyl) through a label, then it would be discounted. However, if you have released on a physical format independently that is ok. Does that make sense? I hope so.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat type of music are we looking for? Well, we will try to keep it as open as possible, because this is about breaking new music, not about rigidly sticking to one genre. However, I think it is fair to say that if you send us a load of opera, hard house, or heavy metal, we probably won't play it. Sorry. But, just to give you an idea, here are some randomly selected examples of stuff we are into:\\r\\n\\r\\nDub \\u0026 Reggae: Roots sound, Studio One, Lee Perry, King Tubby, Augustus Pablo, Horace Andy, Ernest Ranglin etc.\\r\\nFunk: James Brown, Marva Whitney, The Meters, Vicki Anderson etc.\\r\\nSoul: Curtis Mayfield, Cymande, Al Green etc.\\r\\nAfrobeat: Fela Kuti, Tony Allen, The Budos Band etc.\\r\\nModern funk and soul: Lack of Afro, Quantic Soul Orchestra, Alice Russell, Belleruche etc.\\r\\nDrum and Bass: High Contrast, Logistics, Nu:Tone, DJ Marky, Netsky etc.\\r\\nBeats, Electronica \\u0026 Downbeat: Ninja Tune, Warp Records, Bonobo, Four Tet, The Cinematic Orchestra, Hidden Orchestra etc.\\r\\nBlues-Rock: The Black Keys, The Dead Weather etc.\\r\\nOld school Hip Hop: Gang Starr, MOP, KRS One, De La Soul, Artifacts, Lords of The Underground etc.\\r\\nUK Hip Hop: Undercurrent, Lixx, Baron Samedi, Braintax, DJ Format etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, those were off the top of my head, so don't worry if your music doesn't fall exactly into one of those categories, but just to give you an idea of what we're into. To hear a broader selection, have a listen to our Mixcloud podcasts:\\r\\n\\r\\nwww.mixclud.com/theost\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Best way to send us your music. Our ideal file format is wav. If not wav. try to use another uncompressed or lossless format. If you do use mp3 make sure it is maximum quality 320kbps. Remember, sound quality is important! You can send it through Soundcloud using our dropbox. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe look forward to hearing (and playing) your music!\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace, The OST\\r\\n\\r\\n ",

I've had the opportunity to play at several night clubs, weddings, cruiseships and many other functions.  It's an awesome feeling to pump up the crowd and fill the dancefloor with your own special mixes and remixes.  I've estimated spinning for over 3,500 nights in my life thus far.  Many were of the Night Club variety, and now mostly mobile functions.  I love many brands of music.   No faves, But love  Beats, Freestyle, Elementary School, High School, Old Skool, Hip Hop, R/B, Dub Step, Electro House, Trance, 90's Euro, New Wave 80's, Classic Rock, 80 and 90's Pop.  Spun the technics 1200 for the first 15 years, and now cdj's, samplers and drum machines.  Sorry, not into software.  In my books, that's so easy.  I actually want to put an effort in.  Maybe if I was starting out now, sure, I'd give it a try.  Don't need a sync bpm indicator to tell me how fast a song is...lol!  When your old skool, it's like tying a shoe-lace and it comes natural.  Hopefully, you can spread the word and I'm sure you will enjoy some of my mixes.  They will cover so many styles of music.",

It all started at his mother\u2019s South London blues parties, the young Oxman used to hijack the decks whilst the guest sound systems such as Soferno B and Untouchables were taking a break.  In 1976, he played regularly at Clouds on his friend\u2019s sound Cala Hi.

Oxman has provided rare tracks for Soul Jazz and Pressure Sounds compilations. He has also helped compile some of Jet Stars\u2019 recent Reggae Hits series.\\r\\nA problem for DJ\u2019s can be keeping up with the latest musical trends, Oxman has had no such worries as he worked for Larry Lawrence in his Round Two record shop, followed by a spell at Mad Professor\u2019s Ariwa shop. Nowadays, he is to be found behind the counter at Dub Vendor where he has been an integral member of the team for over ten years.\\r\\n \\r\\nOxman has worked on community stations Quest FM, Passion, Lightning and Vibes.

When I was about 18 I leaned how to mix and became a bedroom DJ whilst still writing. When I was 21 I moved to Hastings from London. When I moved to Hastings I feel out the music scene for a couple of years and slowly got back in to by mixing it up in and around town. At this point I started to write again, and after a few years from writing seriously, I\u2019ve come back with a bang! As a D j I\u2019ve shared line up\u2019s with artist such as Tinie Tempa, Tinchy Stryder, Chipmunk, N. Dubz \\u0026 So Solid twins \\u0026 Lil Charlie, along side DJ Caspa aka DJ Andy E. In 2005 I started producing my own music again; mainly Drum \u2018n\u2019 Bass \\u0026 Garage, and in 2008 I linked up with \u2018Riffmatic\u2019 known then as \u2018King\u2019 and started producing music on another level all together, from Drum \u2018n\u2019 Bass to Hip Hop to Rock. With Riffmatic being a Full blown Musician it\u2019s a perfect combination. Since then I\u2019ve been writing and we\u2019ve been producing as much top quality music as possible! Now in 2011, there\u2019s nowhere else to go, other then your Speakers and your TV Screen!\\r\\n\\r\\nRiffmatic: I started Playing the guitar when I was about 9, and have ever since. I have had about 6 years worth of lessons and after that had nothing else to learn. I then moved onto the piano. I started to play out at open mic nights in and around Hastings \\u0026 In 2008 I linked up with Switch and started producing. Ever since then I\u2019ve been to college to study music production and now I\u2019m at university studying Music Production. Although I\u2019m a student in University, I\u2019m far from a student to Music! With my own musical background and influences joined with the influences and long term dedication of Switch, RiffMatics are sure to shake up your music playlists!  \\r\\n",

        "description": "With a multitude of vocalists and musicians vying for public expansion and acknowledgement of their art, having a distinct difference to others has become even more vital in the pursuit for a wider musical community. But there are others that emerge beaming with distinct qualities, an understanding of their art and destined to make that mark. Nyarai very clearly fits this description. Her debut E.P \u2018I\u2019m Here\u2019, is an enticing and emotional body of work that hails the arrival of this multi-faceted talent; and provides an initial window to her world.\\n\\nBorn to Jamaican \\u0026 Mauritian parentage, \u2018Nyarai\u2019 (meaning Be Humble) taught vocal training for young people as a way of self-awareness and development, but didn\u2019t fully enter the vocal world until years later. She states, \u2018\u2026the work with them (young people) really helped to focus my abilities and keep me intent on pursuing a personal goal\u2019. A few years after working with young people, Nyarai joined a musical trio (Yu\u2019niq), working closely with a close friend and her sister (also an avid vocalist) and embarked on a musical journey which spanned approx. 2-3 years. However, as outlined here, Nyarai is a multi-talented artist and had other assets she wished to pursue. As well as her vocal ability, Nyarai also has a performing arts background in dance and dance choreography; and was active in being part of the highly successful Vybe Dance Company in the mid 90\u2019s as well as an active model being involved in showcases such as Afro Hair \\u0026 Beauty and other state shows. She explains, \u2018\u2026We used to just merge art-forms together and just create art. I didn\u2019t really separate them as they always seemed to simply go together. If we\u2019re doing a show, singing, dancing and modelling were all part of it\u2019.\\nNyarai re-entered the performance arena after raising 2 children and being slightly dis-allusioned with the industry and contributed to singing hooks and short verses on spoken word artist (\\u0026 husband) AmeN NoiR\u2019s multiple projects and other features. The desire to create her own platform and put her stamp on things became the vision and further stage performances, solely focusing on singing, were sought out and executed. B.V support for more established artists such as FLOetic Lara paved the way for a return to the vocal industry. \u2018\u2026I just knew that I wanted to return to this art and form a clear path for myself. It just felt right! I had a lot of nerves and had to re-gain my performance confidence, but I just knew this is what I have to pursue\u2019.\\n\\nThose who heard her contributions on various artist projects immediately asked when she would be coming with her own collection of work. The production and musical experience of AmeN NoiR created a platform for Nyarai to begin penning \u2018I\u2019m Here\u2019 and returning to the stage with multiple live acoustic performances and the creation of 2 videos. \u20184 Mumma\u2019 \\u0026 \u2018Patiently Waiting\u2019 videos also opened the door for requests for Nyarai to return to the fashion and modelling world, with requests from various on-line magazines, fashion  lines and hair \\u0026 beauty organisations for Nyarai to represent.\\n\\nThe expansion of writing also increased with the joint venture with AmeN NoiR on the \u2018Spokenology\u2019 mixtape where Nyarai wrote for 80% of the collection and moved closer to taking the lead in creating her own product. \u2018Spokenology\u2019 is a collection of Soul, Jazz, Hip-Hop, R\u2019n\u2019B, \\u0026 Reggae and the unique and creative blend of AmeN\u2019s spoken word and Nyarai\u2019s sensual vocals. This project was intended to be a free download and succeeded in opening the doors for a wider audience to experience Nyarai\u2019s talent and craft.\\n\\nNow becoming more entrenched in song writing and also picking up the guitar as her latest attribute,  Nyarai along with fellow artists FLOetic Lara \\u0026 Indigo created the phenomenal Sista Soul Showcase, presenting a selection of their favourite songs and artists, as well as presented some of their own writings and songs. With a live band and a packed house, the women presented a breath-taking night of art with songs such as the timeless and airy \u20184 women\u2019 by Nina Simone and modern landmark tracks such as \u2018Hold On\u2019 by En Vogue.\\n\\nTaking her influences, like Nina Simone, Chaka Khan, Lalah Hathaway, Ledisi, Erykah Badu \\u0026 Lauryn Hill and using them to shape her own style, Nyarai explains, \u2018\u2026these artists have been a part of my growing-life. They all represent something about me. From the imagery and presentation of Erykah, to the vocal range and use of the lower frequencies of Lalah\u2019 I embrace them all but try to ensure that Nyarai is also heard'.\\n\\nThe appreciation of great artists such as those mentioned, but with the desire to be heard for what she actually represents, has been the fuel for how \u2018I\u2019m Here\u2019 has be constructed. With Jazz, Neo Soul, Hip-Hop \\u0026 Reggae being the driving genres for the debut E.P, Nyarai smoothly transcends from one genre to the next with consummate ease and presents an array of self-discovery issues that you can so easily relate to. \u2018\u2026It\u2019s funny because I initially wanted to speak about my own journey, but after reasoning with friends and people around me, I found that many of the points raised were so common and familiar. That development of self and I guess self-awareness is such a powerful and familiar thing for anyone of any age. The acknowledgement of those learning blocks can help others; and that\u2019s what I wanted to focus on for this debut work\u2019.\\n\\n\u2018I\u2019m Here\u2019 represents the combination of Nyarai \\u0026 AmeN NoiR working in tandem to create a body of work that provides an intro into the world of Nyarai. With both acoustic and full production by AmeN and supporting musicians, \u2018I\u2019m Here\u2019 is littered with both complex, deeper thinking as well as honest, surface viewpoints which speak to the genuine intent of Nyarai and her creation. Gauging a balance between the two has been the challenge for the duo to effectively produce this project. \u2018\u2026I like song-writers that make me think. Writers that when you break down their words reveal so much more. But at the same time I love when things can be said in such a direct and honest way that you just say\u2026.Yes! I get that. That\u2019s what we wanted for this E.P\u2019. \\n\\nWith tracks like \u2018It\u2019s Alright\u2019, Nyarai writes on having belief in yourself, having the awareness that you can control your thoughts and more importantly, knowing that\u2019s alright to be all you can be. The musical structure of this track and 70% of the E.P is around the acoustic guitar. The mellow melodies that permeate through this track really draws the listener into the message that\u2019s being conveyed. Uniquely, the sentiment of \u2018It\u2019s Alright\u2019 is captured in the freedom of the accompanying electric guitars that bounce in and out of the piece, almost giving permission for the guitarist to express freely and ultimately\u2026it\u2019s Alright! \u2018\u2026I wanted to represent the affirmation of not being afraid of shining your light and having the belief that your thoughts become your actions, so think bright\u2019.\\n\u2018Me\u2019 another track on the E.P, also speaks on that self-discovery, the moments of clarity in acknowledging growth. This more up-tempo track delivers a beautiful blend of musicianship and vocal arrangement. The Soul \\u0026 Hip-Hop vibe lives all in this one, but Nyarai brings a delightful vocal performance that really sits you back in the sentiment and feel of what she vocally is telling us. \u2018\u2026I love this one. It was one of the earlier ones written and spoke of plain old simple \u201cwake up man!\u201d wow! In that mirror is me, where have I been? You know?\u2019 \\n\\nAlthough being a relatively new artist, Nyarai feels her stage and performing arts experience enables her to have a head-start on other new-comers. However, she very humbly reminds herself, \u2018\u2026I\u2019m Here\u2019 is exactly that. I\u2019m here! Where I\u2019m going? What needs to improve further?  And the next journey is all ahead of me. I have still so much to learn and develop, but acknowledgement of the journey so far is rewarding in itself. I welcome the next chapter and feel happy with the rate at which I\u2019m growing, but there\u2019s so much to learn\u2019.\\n\\nNyarai is currently performing live, honing her acoustic sets and writing with a band. \u2018\u2026It\u2019s really moving now\u2019 she says. \u2018\u2026It\u2019s a real learning experience, but we all love taking it on the road. I\u2019m excited with the possibilities\u2019. Nyarai is confidently doing what she wants to do. Her positive and reflective message is reaching a wider audience and she herself is enjoying the journey of self-discovery and growth. \u2018I\u2019m Here\u2019 is very much a statement as well as the title of this debut E.P. It is an example of where she\u2019s been, where she\u2019s at and where she\u2019s clearly going. It is sure to win her new fans, and reward the positive stance and depth of her writing.",
